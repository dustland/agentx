AgentX - Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework

A framework for multi-agent collaboration where users can control, monitor, 
and interact with teams of AI agents working together on tasks.

Core Workflow:
    1. Configure team (agents + tools) â†’ team.yaml
    2. Create and start collaborative task
    3. Monitor agent collaboration in real-time  
    4. Access chat and memory interfaces
    5. Fetch results and manage task lifecycle

New Task-Centric API:

# Task Management
from agentx import create_task, get_task, list_tasks

task = create_task("team.yaml")  # Create but don't start
task = get_task(task_id)         # Get existing task
tasks = list_tasks()             # All tasks

# Task Lifecycle
await task.start("description")  # Smart start/resume
await task.stop()               # Stop collaboration
await task.delete()             # Clean up

# Event Handling
task.on("event", handler)
task.off("event", handler)

# Chat Session Access
session = task.get_chat()
history = session.get_chat_history()
await session.send_message("message")

# Memory Operations (via agents)
# Each agent has its own elegant Memory instance
agent.save_memory("content")
agent.search_memory("query")
