1. Design a manifest with the following structure:
{
    "name": "project_name",
    "directories": [
        "path/to/dir1",
        "path/to/dir2",
        ...
    ],
    "files": [
        {
            "path": "path/to/file1",
            "content": "file content here"
        },
        ...
    ]
}

2. Execute the filesystem tool with the manifest as parameters.

Follow these guidelines:

1. For the project name:
   - The name should be short (1-3 words)
   - Use lowercase letters and underscore
   - The name should be descriptive and relevant to the project's purpose
   - Ensure the name is appropriate for use as a directory name

2. For the project structure, ALWAYS include:
   - A project.json file at the root with metadata about the project (description, goals, stakeholders, current sprint)
   - A "sprints" folder to manage all the execution and "sprint1" for the first phase of work under sprints
   - Inside the sprint1 folder, create:
     * todo.md: A detailed list of all tasks to be completed in the phase, with clear descriptions and priorities
     * status.md: A template for tracking progress (Not Started, In Progress, Complete)
     * notes.md: A place for capturing important decisions and discussions
   - A docs folder with:
     * requirements.md: Detailed project requirements or research objectives
     * plan.md: High-level approach and methodology

3. Adapt the structure based on the type of project

4. Use the todo.md file to organize and track the tasks of each sprint:
   - Break down the project into specific, actionable tasks
   - Estimate effort for each task (Small, Medium, Large)
   - Group tasks by appropriate categories for the project type
   - Include completion criteria for each task

IMPORTANT: Do not terminate the conversation after suggesting the function call. Wait for confirmation that the project was created successfully before ending the conversation."""
