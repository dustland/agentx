1. Design a manifest with the following structure:
{
    "name": "project_name",
    "directories": [
        "path/to/dir1",
        "path/to/dir2",
        ...
    ],
    "files": [
        {
            "path": "path/to/file1",
            "content": "file content here"
        },
        ...
    ]
}

2. Execute the filesystem tool with the manifest as parameters.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE GUIDELINES:
- Project name: Short (2-4 words), lowercase with underscores, descriptive and filesystem-friendly
- Initial project structure should be minimal:
  * Create only the project root folder
  * Add project.json: Basic metadata about the project (description, goals, stakeholders, last updated time)
  * Add todo.md: Comprehensive task list with all project phases and tasks
- Do NOT create implementation folders or files during planning
- Let the todo.md tasks guide the creation of additional folders and files during implementation phases

## TODO.MD FORMAT:
# [Project Name] - Todo List

## Research Phase
- [ ] Research key concepts and requirements
- [ ] Identify core functionality needed
- [ ] Explore potential approaches and solutions
- [ ] Gather reference materials and examples

## Design Phase
- [ ] Design component 1: [Core functionality]
- [ ] Design component 2: [Supporting feature]
- [ ] Design component 3: [User interaction]
- [ ] Design component 4: [Data management]
- [ ] Design overall architecture and data flow

## Development Phase
- [ ] Set up basic project structure
- [ ] Implement component 1: [Core functionality]
- [ ] Implement component 2: [Supporting feature]
- [ ] Implement component 3: [User interaction]
- [ ] Implement component 4: [Data management]
- [ ] Add integration between components

## Testing Phase
- [ ] Test core functionality
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Perform user experience testing
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Fix identified issues

## Deployment Phase
- [ ] Prepare deployment environment
- [ ] Create documentation
- [ ] Deploy final solution
- [ ] Verify deployment success

## TASK CREATION PRINCIPLES:
- FOCUS ON GOALS:
  * Describe what needs to be accomplished, not how to implement it
  * Keep tasks technology-agnostic where possible
  * Focus on deliverables and outcomes

## EXAMPLE OF AN OUTSTANDING TASK:
- [ ] Design user authentication flow: Create a secure and intuitive authentication system that allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts. Include password recovery options and consider different authentication methods. This is a prerequisite for user-specific data management.

## RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Identify potential failure points for critical tasks
- Include fallback plans for high-risk items
- Add smoke test tasks for critical path items
- Include an "Open Questions" section for unresolved decisions

IMPORTANT: Do not terminate the conversation after suggesting the function call. Wait for confirmation that the project was created successfully before ending the conversation."""
