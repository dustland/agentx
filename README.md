AgentX provides the backbone for creating, orchestrating, and observing sophisticated multi-agent systems. It moves beyond simple agent-to-agent communication to a robust, task-driven framework where teams of specialized agents collaborate to achieve complex goals.

Based on a refined and modular architecture, AgentX is built around a few core concepts:

- **ü§ñ Multi-Agent Teams**: Define teams of specialized agents in simple YAML files. Each agent can have its own role, tools, and configuration.
- **üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Orchestration**: Agents hand off tasks to each other using natural language. A central `TaskExecutor` interprets these handoffs and routes work to the appropriate agent, enabling complex, dynamic workflows.
- **üõ†Ô∏è Secure & Extensible Tools**: Tools are defined with Python decorators and their schemas are automatically generated. Shell commands are executed in a secure Docker sandbox, providing safety and isolation. A flexible `ToolExecutor` manages the entire lifecycle.
- **üß† Stateful & Context-Aware Memory**: Agents maintain long-term memory, enabling them to recall past interactions and context. The memory system supports semantic search, ensuring agents have the information they need, when they need it.
- **üì° Streamable Communication**: The entire lifecycle of a task, from agent thoughts to tool calls and results, is available as a real-time stream of events. This allows you to build rich, observable UIs like the Vercel AI SDK.
- **üéØ Task-Centric API**: Interact with the system through a simple, powerful API. Kick off complex workflows with `execute_task()` or manage interactive sessions with `start_task()`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The best way to get started is by following our **[Quickstart Guide](./docs/quickstart.md)**, which will walk you through building a simple chat application and a multi-agent writer/reviewer team.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dustland/agentx.git
    cd agentx
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    uv sync
    ```

Complete working examples in `examples/`:

### [Simple Team](examples/simple_team/) - Basic Collaboration

Basic multi-agent collaboration demonstrating Brain-powered reasoning:

```bash
# Using CLI
agentx example simple_team

# Or directly
cd examples/simple_team
python demo.py
```

### CLI Commands

This framework comes with a convenient CLI tool for management:

```bash
# Start API server with observability
agentx start

# Start observability monitor (CLI interface)
agentx monitor

# Start web dashboard
agentx monitor --web

# Run examples
agentx example superwriter

# Check system status
agentx status
```

### Python API

```python
import asyncio
from agentx import execute_task

async def main():
    # Create a task with your team configuration
    result = execute_task("Write a brief report on renewable energy trends")

    print(f"Success: {result.success}")
    print(f"Summary: {result.summary}")
    print(f"Conversation rounds: {len(result.conversation_history)}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

This is autonomous run. You can refer to examples for message streaming and interactive running.

## üìä Observability & Monitoring

AgentX includes a comprehensive observability system for monitoring and debugging multi-agent workflows:

### Web Dashboard

Modern FastAPI + Preline UI dashboard with:

- **Dashboard**: System overview with metrics and recent activity
- **Tasks**: Task conversation history viewer with export
- **Events**: Real-time event monitoring with filtering
- **Memory**: Memory browser with search and categories
- **Messages**: Agent conversation history during execution
- **Configuration**: System configuration and status viewer with data directory management

```bash
# Start web dashboard
agentx monitor --web
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

AgentX is a modular framework composed of several key components that work together to execute complex tasks. At its heart is the `TaskExecutor`, which manages the overall workflow. It interacts with a `Team of Agents` to perform work, and consults the `Orchestrator` to handle agent sequencing and tool calls.

This project was initially inspired by and built upon concepts from [AG2 (AutoGen)](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2), an excellent multi-agent conversation framework. While AgentX has evolved into its own distinct architecture and approach, we're grateful for the foundational ideas and patterns that AG2 provided to the multi-agent AI community.
