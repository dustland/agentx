## Overview

RoboCo is a powerful platform that combines Domain-Driven Design with Multi-Agent Systems to create intelligent, collaborative AI teams. Built with a clean architecture that separates concerns into domain, application, infrastructure, and interface layers, RoboCo enables you to build sophisticated AI applications with minimal boilerplate.

## Key Features

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns and dependency injection
- **Multi-Agent Teams**: Specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems
- **Sprint Management**: Built-in project and sprint management for agile development
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol for enhanced agent communication and reasoning
- **Extensible Tools**: Plug-and-play tools for research, analysis, and interaction
- **REST API**: Comprehensive API with FastAPI for seamless integration
- **Workspace Management**: Organized workspaces for artifacts and project resources

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/dustland/roboco.git
cd roboco

# Setup environment
./setup.sh  # On Unix/macOS
# or
setup.bat   # On Windows

# Configure API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start the API server
./start.sh  # Uses default host (127.0.0.1) and port (8000)
# Or with custom options
./start.sh --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --reload

# If installed as a package
pip install -e .
roboco-api  # Starts the API server using installed package
roboco-api-dev  # Starts the API server in development mode with auto-reload
roboco-db-api  # Starts a minimal database API server
```

- [Tool System](docs/tool.md) - Tool system
- [MCP](docs/mcp.md) - Model-Context-Protocol support

## Configuration

RoboCo uses environment variables for configuration with sensible defaults:

```
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
WORKSPACE_DIR=~/roboco_workspace
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

The `start.sh` script provides a convenient way to launch the API server with various configuration options:

```bash
# Basic usage
./start.sh

# Available options
./start.sh --host=0.0.0.0     # Bind to all interfaces
./start.sh --port=8080        # Use custom port
./start.sh --reload           # Enable auto-reload for development
./start.sh --workers=4        # Use multiple worker processes
./start.sh --help             # Show all available options
```

When using the `roboco-api` script, you can configure the server with environment variables:

```bash
# Set host and port via environment variables
HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=8080 roboco-api

# Or export them for the session
export HOST=0.0.0.0
export PORT=8080
roboco-api
```
