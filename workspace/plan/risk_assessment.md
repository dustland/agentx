## Monitoring and Response

### Early Warning Indicators

- Integration test failures
- Performance regression in benchmarks
- Increasing number of connection errors
- Negative feedback on documentation clarity
- Adoption rate lower than expected

### Response Plans

1. **Technical Issues**:

   - Establish dedicated time for bug fixes
   - Prioritize critical issues affecting core functionality
   - Consider rolling back to previous version if severe issues are found

2. **Resource Issues**:

   - Have contingency budget for additional resources
   - Identify team members who can provide backup support
   - Prepare for potential schedule adjustments

3. **Adoption Issues**:
   - Gather specific user feedback on barriers to adoption
   - Enhance documentation and examples based on feedback
   - Consider creating migration tools if needed
