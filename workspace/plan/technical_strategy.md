# GenesisAgent Remote Server Integration - Technical Strategy

## Architecture Overview

We'll implement a modular transport layer for GenesisAgent that abstracts the communication method between the client and server. This will allow us to support both the existing stdio transport and new network-based transports like SSE.

### Key Components

1. **Transport Interface**: Create a common interface that all transport implementations must follow
2. **Transport Factory**: Build a factory pattern to instantiate the appropriate transport based on configuration
3. **SSE Transport Implementation**: Create an SSE-based transport that implements the common interface
4. **Configuration System**: Extend the existing configuration system to support transport selection and parameters

## Transport Interface Design

```python
class MCPTransport:
    """Base interface for MCP server transport mechanisms."""

    async def connect(self) -> Tuple[asyncio.StreamReader, asyncio.StreamWriter]:
        """Establish connection to the MCP server and return read/write streams."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    async def disconnect(self) -> None:
        """Close the connection to the MCP server."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

## Transport Implementations

### StdioTransport (Existing)

- Wraps the current stdio_client functionality
- Spawns a local subprocess for the MCP server
- Communicates through standard input/output pipes

### SSETransport (New)

- Connects to a remote server via HTTP
- Uses Server-Sent Events for server-to-client communication
- Implements HTTP POST requests for client-to-server communication
- Handles reconnection logic and error states

## Enhanced GenesisAgent

The GenesisAgent class will be updated to:

1. Accept a transport configuration parameter
2. Use the TransportFactory to create the appropriate transport instance
3. Maintain the same API interface for existing code
4. Provide additional connection information for remote transports

## Configuration Structure

```python
# Example configuration structure
transport_config = {
    "type": "sse",  # or "stdio"
    "server_url": "https://example.com/mcp-server",  # for SSE
    "auth_token": "...",  # for SSE
    "command": "genesis-mcp",  # for stdio
    "args": [],  # for stdio
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

To maintain backward compatibility:

- Default to stdio transport if no transport configuration is provided
- Keep existing constructor parameters but mark as deprecated
- Provide helper methods to convert between old and new parameter formats

## Error Handling Strategy

1. Implement robust connection timeout handling
2. Add automatic reconnection attempts with backoff
3. Provide detailed error information specific to transport type
4. Log comprehensive connection details for debugging
5. Include connection status in agent state
