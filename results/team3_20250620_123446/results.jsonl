{"question_id": "17b5a6a3-bc87-42e8-b0fb-6ab0781ef2cc", "question": "I’m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There’s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place.", "predicted_answer": "I couldn't directly access the specific data about the zip codes where the clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris) was found as a nonnative species before 2020 from the USGS database due to tool restrictions. However, based on the search results, the relevant information is likely available in the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database, specifically on the [clown anemonefish species profile page](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?speciesID=3243).\n\nTo proceed, you may need to manually visit the linked page or consult the USGS NAS database directly to extract the required zip codes. If you'd like, I can guide you on how to navigate the database to find this information. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!", "ground_truth": "34689", "level": "2", "processing_time": 46.471741914749146, "status": "completed", "error": null, "timestamp": "2025-06-20T12:35:32.569259"}
