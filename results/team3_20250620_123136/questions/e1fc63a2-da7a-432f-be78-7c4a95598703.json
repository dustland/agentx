  "question": "If Eliud Kipchoge could maintain his record-making marathon pace indefinitely, how many thousand hours would it take him to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon its closest approach? Please use the minimum perigee value on the Wikipedia page for the Moon when carrying out your calculation. Round your result to the nearest 1000 hours and do not use any comma separators if necessary.",
  "predicted_answer": "To answer this question, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find Eliud Kipchoge's marathon pace**: Determine his record-making marathon pace in kilometers per hour.\n2. **Find the minimum perigee distance between Earth and the Moon**: Use the Wikipedia page for the Moon to get this value in kilometers.\n3. **Calculate the time required**: Divide the distance by his pace to get the time in hours, then round to the nearest 1000 hours.\n\nLet me begin by gathering the necessary data.1. **Eliud Kipchoge's marathon pace**: From the search results, his record-making marathon pace is **21.02 km/h** (from the 2022 Berlin Marathon).\n\n2. **Minimum perigee distance between Earth and the Moon**: The smallest perigee distance is approximately **356,400 km** (from Wikipedia and other sources).\n\nNow, calculate the time required to run this distance at Kipchoge's pace:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time (hours)} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Pace}} = \\frac{356,400 \\text{ km}}{21.02 \\text{ km/h}} \\approx 16,960 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest 1000 hours:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} \\approx 17,000 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer**: 17000",
