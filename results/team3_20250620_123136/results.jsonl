Round the value up to the next integer.", "predicted_answer": "To determine how many papers would be incorrect in their claims of statistical significance, we can use the concept of the false positive rate in hypothesis testing. The p-value threshold for statistical significance is typically set at 0.05. If the average p-value is 0.04, we can assume that some of these results are false positives.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **False Positive Rate**: At a p-value threshold of 0.05, the false positive rate is 5%. This means that 5% of the statistically significant results are expected to be incorrect (false positives).\n2. **Total Papers**: Let \\( N \\) be the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020 that relied on statistical significance.\n3. **Incorrect Papers**: The number of incorrect papers would be \\( 0.05 \\times N \\).\n\nHowever, the question does not provide the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020. To proceed, we need this number. Let me search for the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020.The search results did not directly provide the total number of articles published by Nature in 2020.
