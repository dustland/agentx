# GAIA Benchmark for VibeX Framework

A comprehensive benchmark implementation for evaluating agent teams on the GAIA (General AI Assistant) dataset using the VibeX multi-agent framework.

## Quick Start

### Using PyProject Scripts (Recommended)

The benchmark includes convenient scripts in `pyproject.toml` for easy execution:

```bash
# Quick test with 5 questions (team3)
uv run benchmark-quick

# Run full benchmark with specific teams
uv run benchmark-team1
uv run benchmark-team2
uv run benchmark-team3

# Run benchmark with custom options
uv run benchmark --team team1 --limit 10 --verbose
```

### Manual Execution

You can also run the benchmark manually:

```bash
# Run with team1 configuration
uv run python benchmark/main.py --team team1

# Run limited test with verbose output
uv run python benchmark/main.py --team team3 --limit 10 --verbose

# Resume from checkpoint
uv run python benchmark/main.py --team team1 --resume --checkpoint-dir results/team1_20231201_120000
```

## Available Scripts

- **`benchmark`**: Main benchmark script with full argument control
- **`benchmark-team1`**: Run benchmark with team1 configuration
- **`benchmark-team2`**: Run benchmark with team2 configuration
- **`benchmark-team3`**: Run benchmark with team3 configuration
- **`benchmark-quick`**: Quick test with team3 and 5 questions (verbose mode)

## Configuration

### Team Configurations

The benchmark includes three pre-configured team setups:

- **Team 1**: Multi-agent research team (Coordinator, Researcher, Analyst, Synthesizer)
- **Team 2**: Task-focused team (Planner, Executor, Validator)
- **Team 3**: Single agent setup (GAIA Agent)

Each team configuration is located in `config/team{1,2,3}/` with:

- `team.yaml`: Team structure and agent definitions
- `prompts/`: Individual agent prompt templates

### Options

- `--team`: Team configuration (team1, team2, team3)
- `--limit`: Limit number of questions for testing
- `--concurrent`: Number of concurrent tasks (default: 3)
- `--split`: Dataset split - validation or test (default: validation)
- `--timeout`: Timeout per question in seconds (default: 300)
- `--resume`: Resume from checkpoint
- `--checkpoint-dir`: Specific checkpoint directory
- `--output-dir`: Output directory for results (default: results)
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging

## Output

Results are saved to `results/` directory with:

- Individual question results (JSON)
- Final aggregated results
- Evaluation metrics
- Progress checkpoints

## Evaluation Metrics

- Overall accuracy
- Per-level accuracy (Level 1, 2, 3)
- Success rate
- Average processing time
- Total processing time

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- VibeX framework installed (`uv pip install -e .`)
- Required API keys (OpenAI, SERP API, etc.) configured in environment

pip install vibex-py

# Or install from source
cd /path/to/vibex
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Dataset Preparation

Download the GAIA dataset and place it in the datasets directory:

```bash
# Create datasets directory
mkdir -p benchmark/datasets/gaia

# Download GAIA validation set (dev.json) to:
# benchmark/datasets/gaia/dev.json
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Set up your API keys and environment variables:

```bash
# For DeepSeek (recommended for cost efficiency)
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_deepseek_api_key"

# For Claude (if using team2)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"

# Optional: Enable verbose logging
export VIBEX_VERBOSE=1
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run with Team 1 (collaborative approach)
python benchmark/main.py --team team1

# Run with Team 2 (sequential planning)
python benchmark/main.py --team team2

# Run with Team 3 (single agent baseline)
python benchmark/main.py --team team3
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Test with limited questions for development
python benchmark/main.py --team team1 --limit 10

# Run with custom concurrency and timeout
python benchmark/main.py --team team1 --concurrent-limit 5 --timeout 600

# Resume from checkpoint
python benchmark/main.py --team team1 --resume --checkpoint-dir results/team1_20240101_120000
