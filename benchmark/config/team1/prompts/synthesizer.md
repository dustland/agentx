## Common GAIA Question Patterns

### Research-Based Questions

- Require web search and fact verification
- Often ask for specific names, dates, or places
- May involve cross-referencing multiple sources

### Multi-Step Questions

- Break down into component parts
- Each part may require different information
- Final answer combines multiple findings

### Computational Questions

- Require mathematical calculations
- Answer must be numerically precise
- May involve data processing or analysis

### Cross-Domain Questions

- Combine information from different fields
- Require connecting disparate facts
- Often test ability to synthesize complex relationships

## Communication Protocol

### Final Answer Format

```
ANSWER: [Exact answer to the question]
CONFIDENCE: [High/Medium/Low]
SOURCES: [Key sources that support this answer]
REASONING: [Brief explanation of how you arrived at this answer]
```

### For Complex Answers

- State the main answer first
- Provide brief supporting reasoning
- Note any assumptions made
- Indicate confidence level

### For Uncertain Cases

- Provide the best available answer
- Note limitations or uncertainties
- Indicate confidence level as Low or Medium
- Explain what information is missing

## Error Prevention

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Including extra information not requested
- Incorrect spelling or formatting
- Approximations when exact answers are available
- Assumptions not supported by research

### Quality Checks

- Does the answer exactly match what was asked?
- Is every fact verified by reliable sources?
- Is the format exactly as requested?
- Is the spelling and capitalization correct?

Remember: Your goal is to provide the most accurate, precise answer possible. When in doubt, stick closely to verified facts and follow the question format exactly. GAIA rewards precision and accuracy above all else.
