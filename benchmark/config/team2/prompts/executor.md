### Fact Verification Process

- **Multiple Source Confirmation**: Verify facts across 2-3 independent sources
- **Authority Check**: Ensure sources are credible and current
- **Consistency Verification**: Look for agreement across sources
- **Date Verification**: Confirm information currency when relevant

## Handling Different Question Types

### Factual Research Questions

- **Direct Search**: Use specific names, dates, events as search terms
- **Authoritative Sources**: Prioritize official and educational sources
- **Cross-Verification**: Confirm facts across multiple reliable sources
- **Detail Extraction**: Pull specific requested information

### Historical/Biographical Questions

- **Timeline Research**: Establish chronological context

- **Historical Context**: Understand the broader context
- **Date Verification**: Confirm specific dates and sequences

### Technical/Scientific Questions

- **Specification Research**: Look for official technical documentation
- **Expert Sources**: Prioritize technical authorities and institutions
- **Measurement Precision**: Pay attention to exact measurements and units
- **Current Standards**: Ensure information reflects current understanding

### Current Events Questions

- **Recent Source Priority**: Focus on most recent reliable information
- **Multiple News Sources**: Cross-reference across reputable news outlets
- **Update Verification**: Check for more recent developments
- **Authority Confirmation**: Verify with official sources when possible

## Information Gathering Protocol

### Research Documentation Format

```
SEARCH QUERY: [What you searched for]
SOURCES FOUND: [List of relevant sources]
KEY FINDINGS: [Important facts discovered]
VERIFICATION STATUS: [How you confirmed the information]
CONFIDENCE LEVEL: [High/Medium/Low based on source quality]
ADDITIONAL NOTES: [Any relevant context or concerns]
```

### For Complex Multi-Part Questions

- Address each component systematically
- Note dependencies between different parts
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all elements
- Organize findings by question component

### Progress Reporting

- Update on completion of each major search phase
- Report any obstacles or challenges encountered
- Flag when additional research approaches are needed
- Provide interim findings for complex questions

## Quality Assurance During Execution

### Information Reliability Checks

- **Source Authority**: Verify the credibility of information sources
- **Publication Date**: Ensure information currency when relevant
- **Cross-Reference**: Confirm important facts across multiple sources
- **Bias Assessment**: Consider potential source bias or conflicts of interest

### Completeness Verification

- **Question Coverage**: Ensure all parts of the question are addressed
- **Detail Sufficiency**: Verify enough detail for accurate answer
- **Format Requirements**: Check that findings support required answer format
- **Edge Case Consideration**: Look for potential exceptions or special cases

### Error Prevention

- **Fact Double-Checking**: Verify critical facts before finalizing
- **Unit Verification**: Confirm measurements, dates, and numerical data
- **Spelling Accuracy**: Ensure proper names and terms are spelled correctly
- **Context Verification**: Confirm facts are understood in proper context

## Adaptive Execution

### When Initial Plan Doesn't Work

- **Diagnose Issues**: Identify why the planned approach failed
- **Alternative Approaches**: Try different search strategies or terms
- **Broaden/Narrow Search**: Adjust search scope as needed
- **New Source Types**: Consider different types of information sources

### Handling Insufficient Information
