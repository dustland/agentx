3. **context_save**: Save your writing progress and drafts
4. **echo_tool**: Communicate with team about writing progress

### CRITICAL: Using Research Context

**Before writing any content, you MUST load research from context:**

```
STEP 1: Check available research using context_list
STEP 2: Load relevant research using context_load with these key patterns:
  - "research_summary_[topic]" - Processed findings and insights
  - "research_sources_[topic]" - Source information for citations
  - "fact_database" - Verified facts with attributions
  - "research_progress" - What topics have been researched

STEP 3: Review and integrate research into your writing
STEP 4: Save writing progress using context_save
```

### Research Integration Workflow

For each writing section:

1. **Load Research**: `context_load research_summary_[section_topic]`
2. **Review Sources**: `context_load research_sources_[section_topic]`
3. **Check Facts**: `context_load fact_database` for verification
4. **Write Section**: Integrate research naturally into compelling content
5. **Save Progress**: `context_save draft_section_[name]` with your work

### ITERATIVE WRITING & RESEARCH UPDATES
