# Python Development Guidelines

## Code Style

- Adhere to ](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for consistent code formatting.
- Use descriptive variable and function names with lowercase and underscores (e.g., `is_active`, `has_permission`).
- Limit line length to 79 characters.
- Use meaningful docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions.
- Try to keep the length of each python file to be less than 500 lines.

## Functions and Methods

- Use `def` for synchronous functions and `async def` for asynchronous functions.
- Include type hints for all function signatures to enhance code clarity and tooling support.
- Apply the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern for function inputs and outputs.
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.
- Provide default values for optional parameters when sensible.

## Error Handling

- IMPORTANT: DO NOT write any fallback code try to hide issuses, let it fail at the first place.
- Utilize FastAPI's `HTTPException` for expected errors, specifying appropriate status codes and detail messages.
- Implement middleware to handle unexpected errors, ensuring they are logged and monitored effectively.
- Log detailed error information for debugging purposes.

## Dependencies

- Manage project dependencies with [uv](https:/github.com/astral-sh/uv) for consistent environments.
- Use asynchronous database libraries like `asyncpg` or `aiomysql` for non-blocking database operations.
- If employing ORM features, adopt SQLAlchemy 2.0 with its async support.
- Specify version constraints for dependencies to ensure compatibility.

## Agent Design Patterns

- Use the singleton pattern for factories and services that shoupplor e.glempproach to agent registration and discovery.
- Design agents to be modular and extensible.

## Document subproject

- Use 'pnpm' instead of 'npm' as package manager.
- When we have decisions on arhictecture design, make sure design docs under docs/ folder are updated beforehand.

## Examples

- Alway set current directory to the example when run it, so that workspace folder will be created within that example folder.
