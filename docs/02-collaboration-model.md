# 02: Collaboration Model

This document defines how agents collaborate in multi-agent teams within the AgentX framework. It focuses on team dynamics, orchestrator behavior, handoff mechanisms, and message flow patterns.

## 1. Team Collaboration Architecture

### 1.1. Team Structure

A **Team** is a collection of specialized agents working together toward a common goal:

```yaml
name: "ContentTeam"
description: "Collaborative content creation and review"

agents:
  - name: "researcher"
    role: "Information gathering and fact-checking"
  - name: "writer"
    role: "Content creation and drafting"
  - name: "reviewer"
    role: "Quality assurance and editing"
  - name: "publisher"
    role: "Final formatting and distribution"
```

**Team Characteristics:**

- **Shared Context**: All agents have access to the complete conversation history
- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has distinct capabilities and responsibilities
- **Collaborative Memory**: Work artifacts and progress are preserved across handoffs
- **Dynamic Coordination**: The orchestrator manages workflow based on natural completion signals

### 1.2. Agent Collaboration Patterns

**Sequential Collaboration:**

```
Researcher → Writer → Reviewer → Publisher
```

Linear workflow where each agent builds on previous work.

**Iterative Collaboration:**

```
Writer ↔ Reviewer (until approved) → Publisher
```

Agents work in cycles, refining output through feedback loops.

**Parallel Collaboration:**

```
Researcher A (Topic 1) ┐
Researcher B (Topic 2) ├→ Writer → Reviewer
Researcher C (Topic 3) ┘
```

Multiple agents work simultaneously, with coordination points.

**Consensus Collaboration:**

```
Expert A ┐
Expert B ├→ Synthesizer → Final Decision
Expert C ┘
```

Multiple perspectives combined into unified output.

## 2. Orchestrator Design

### 2.1. Orchestrator Responsibilities

The **Orchestrator** is the intelligent coordinator that manages team collaboration:

**Work Routing:**

- Analyzes agent completion signals using natural language understanding
- Selects the most appropriate next agent based on context and capabilities
- Manages work queues and handles conflicts
- Routes based on handoff conditions and team state

**Context Management:**

- Maintains shared conversation history across all agents
- Preserves work artifacts and progress tracking
- Ensures information continuity during handoffs
- Manages team memory and context variables

**Flow Control:**

- Detects natural completion signals from agents
- Applies handoff rules and conditions
- Handles after-work behavior when no handoffs match
- Manages termination and error conditions

### 2.2. Intelligent Routing Algorithm

The orchestrator uses a multi-layered approach to determine handoffs:

```python
def determine_next_agent(agent_response, team_context):
    # 1. Check explicit handoff conditions
    for handoff in team.handoffs:
        if matches_condition(agent_response, handoff.condition):
            return handoff.to_agent

    # 2. Use LLM analysis for natural language understanding
    next_agent = analyze_completion_with_llm(agent_response, possible_handoffs)
    if next_agent:
        return next_agent

    # 3. Apply after_work_behavior
    return apply_after_work_behavior(team.after_work_behavior)
```

**Routing Priority:**

1. **Explicit Conditions**: Defined handoff rules take precedence
2. **LLM Analysis**: Natural language understanding of completion signals
3. **After-Work Behavior**: Team-level default when no conditions match

### 2.3. Context Transfer Mechanism

When a handoff occurs, the orchestrator ensures seamless context transfer:

```python
def execute_handoff(from_agent, to_agent, context):
    # Preserve complete conversation history
    context.history.append({
        'agent': from_agent,
        'response': agent_response,
        'timestamp': now(),
        'handoff_reason': handoff_condition
    })

    # Transfer artifacts and work products
    context.artifacts = preserve_artifacts(context.artifacts)

    # Update current agent
    context.current_agent = to_agent

    # Render new agent prompt with full context
    prompt = render_agent_prompt(to_agent, context)
```

## 3. Handoff Design

### 3.1. Handoff Philosophy

Handoffs should feel natural and intuitive, like human team collaboration:

- **Natural Language Conditions**: Describe completion in human terms
- **Context-Aware**: Consider team state and work progress
- **Flexible Routing**: Support both simple and complex decision logic
- **Self-Documenting**: Handoff rules explain team workflow

### 3.2. Handoff Structure

```yaml
handoffs:
  - from_agent: "writer"
    to_agent: "reviewer"
    condition: "draft is complete and ready for review"
    priority: 1

  - from_agent: "reviewer"
    to_agent: "writer"
    condition: "feedback has been provided and revisions are needed"
    priority: 1

  - from_agent: "reviewer"
    to_agent: "publisher"
    condition: "content is approved for publication"
    priority: 2
```

**Field Definitions:**

- **`from_agent`**: Source agent name
- **`to_agent`**: Destination agent name
- **`condition`**: Natural language description of when to handoff
- **`priority`**: Higher numbers take precedence (optional, default: 1)

### 3.3. Condition Types

**Simple Completion:**

```yaml
condition: "research is complete"
condition: "draft is finished"
condition: "review is done"
```

**Quality-Based:**

```yaml
condition: "content meets quality standards"
condition: "all requirements are satisfied"
condition: "no errors found"
```

**Context-Aware:**

```yaml
condition: "research batch complete and source_count >= {{ min_sources }}"
condition: "confidence_score > {{ threshold }} and ready for review"
condition: "iteration_count < {{ max_iterations }} and needs revision"
```

**Multi-Condition:**

```yaml
condition: "draft complete and word_count >= {{ min_words }} and all sections included"
```

### 3.4. After-Work Behavior

When no handoff conditions match, the team applies default behavior:

```yaml
# Team-level configuration
after_work_behavior: "return_to_user" # Default
```

**Options:**

- **`"return_to_user"`**: Hand control back to user (default)
- **`"terminate"`**: End the task successfully
- **`"continue"`**: Keep the conversation going with current agent

## 4. Message Flow Patterns

### 4.1. Basic Message Flow

```
User Request → Orchestrator → Agent A → [Work] → Completion Signal →
Orchestrator Analysis → Agent B → [Work] → ... → Final Response
```

**Flow Steps:**

1. **User Input**: Initial task or follow-up message
2. **Agent Selection**: Orchestrator chooses appropriate agent
3. **Context Preparation**: Full history and artifacts provided to agent
4. **Agent Work**: Agent processes task using tools and capabilities
5. **Completion Detection**: Orchestrator analyzes response for handoff signals
6. **Handoff Decision**: Apply rules, LLM analysis, or after-work behavior
7. **Context Transfer**: Preserve history and artifacts for next agent

### 4.2. Conversation History Structure

Each message in the conversation history contains:

```python
{
    'step_id': 'unique_identifier',
    'agent_name': 'writer',
    'timestamp': '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z',
    'parts': [
        {
            'type': 'text',
            'text': 'I have completed the first draft...'
        }
    ],
    'artifacts': ['draft_v1.md', 'research_notes.json'],
    'handoff_triggered': True,
    'handoff_target': 'reviewer'
}
```

### 4.3. Context Variables and Templates

Teams can use context variables for dynamic handoff conditions:

```yaml
# Team configuration
context_variables:
  min_sources: 5
  confidence_threshold: 0.8
  max_iterations: 3

handoffs:
  - from_agent: "researcher"
    to_agent: "writer"
    condition: "research complete and source_count >= {{ min_sources }}"
```

**Variable Sources:**

- **Team Configuration**: Predefined values
- **Runtime Context**: Dynamic values from agent work
- **User Input**: Parameters provided by user
- **System State**: Current team and task status

## 5. Advanced Collaboration Patterns

### 5.1. Multi-Stage Workflows

Complex workflows with multiple phases:

```yaml
handoffs:
  # Phase 1: Research
  - from_agent: "coordinator"
    to_agent: "researcher"
    condition: "research phase needed"

  - from_agent: "researcher"
    to_agent: "analyst"
    condition: "raw data collected and needs analysis"

  # Phase 2: Content Creation
  - from_agent: "analyst"
    to_agent: "writer"
    condition: "analysis complete and insights ready"

  - from_agent: "writer"
    to_agent: "reviewer"
    condition: "draft complete"

  # Phase 3: Quality Assurance
  - from_agent: "reviewer"
    to_agent: "writer"
    condition: "revisions needed"

  - from_agent: "reviewer"
    to_agent: "publisher"
    condition: "content approved"
```

### 5.2. Conditional Branching

Different paths based on work outcomes:

```yaml
handoffs:
  - from_agent: "analyzer"
    to_agent: "simple_writer"
    condition: "analysis shows simple topic"

  - from_agent: "analyzer"
    to_agent: "expert_writer"
    condition: "analysis shows complex topic requiring expertise"

  - from_agent: "analyzer"
    to_agent: "researcher"
    condition: "insufficient data for analysis"
```

### 5.3. Quality Gates

Handoffs based on quality thresholds:

```yaml
handoffs:
  - from_agent: "writer"
    to_agent: "reviewer"
    condition: "draft complete and word_count >= {{ min_words }}"

  - from_agent: "reviewer"
    to_agent: "writer"
    condition: "quality_score < {{ min_quality }} and revision_count < {{ max_revisions }}"

  - from_agent: "reviewer"
    to_agent: "publisher"
    condition: "quality_score >= {{ min_quality }}"
```

## 6. Team Coordination Strategies

### 6.1. Work Distribution

**Load Balancing:**

```yaml
handoffs:
  - from_agent: "coordinator"
    to_agent: "writer_a"
    condition: "writing needed and writer_a_load < writer_b_load"

  - from_agent: "coordinator"
    to_agent: "writer_b"
    condition: "writing needed and writer_b_load <= writer_a_load"
```

**Expertise Matching:**

```yaml
handoffs:
  - from_agent: "triager"
    to_agent: "technical_writer"
    condition: "topic requires technical expertise"

  - from_agent: "triager"
    to_agent: "creative_writer"
    condition: "topic requires creative approach"
```

### 6.2. Collaboration Coordination

**Synchronization Points:**

```yaml
handoffs:
  - from_agent: "researcher_a"
    to_agent: "synthesizer"
    condition: "research_a complete and research_b complete"

  - from_agent: "researcher_b"
    to_agent: "synthesizer"
    condition: "research_b complete and research_a complete"
```

**Dependency Management:**

```yaml
handoffs:
  - from_agent: "requirements_analyst"
    to_agent: "architect"
    condition: "requirements complete"

  - from_agent: "architect"
    to_agent: "developer"
    condition: "architecture approved and requirements_complete"
```

## 7. Error Handling and Recovery

### 7.1. Collaborative Error Management

**Error Detection in Handoffs:**

```yaml
handoffs:
  - from_agent: "any_agent"
    to_agent: "error_handler"
    condition: "error detected or quality issues found"
    priority: 10 # High priority
```

**Recovery Strategies:**

```yaml
handoffs:
  - from_agent: "error_handler"
    to_agent: "previous_agent"
    condition: "error resolved and retry possible"

  - from_agent: "error_handler"
    to_agent: "supervisor"
    condition: "error requires human intervention"
```

### 7.2. Quality Assurance Integration

**Continuous Quality Checks:**

```yaml
handoffs:
  - from_agent: "writer"
    to_agent: "quality_checker"
    condition: "draft complete"

  - from_agent: "quality_checker"
    to_agent: "writer"
    condition: "quality issues found"

  - from_agent: "quality_checker"
    to_agent: "reviewer"
    condition: "quality standards met"
```

## 8. Implementation Considerations
