# Domain-Driven Design in Roboco

## Introduction

This document outlines how Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles are applied in the Roboco project. DDD is an approach to software development that focuses on creating a rich, expressive domain model that reflects the business domain, with clear boundaries between different parts of the system.

## Core DDD Concepts

### Ubiquitous Language

A shared language between developers and domain experts that is used consistently in code, documentation, and conversation.

**Implementation in Roboco:**
- Domain models named to match business concepts: `Project`, `Sprint`, `TodoItem`
- Methods named to reflect business operations: `create_project`, `assign_todo`, `complete_sprint`
- Consistent terminology across all layers of the application

### Domain Model

The heart of the software, representing the core business concepts, rules, and logic.

**Implementation in Roboco:**
- Domain models in `core/models/` contain business logic and invariants
- Rich behavior methods that enforce business rules
- Models represent real business entities rather than data structures

### Bounded Contexts

Explicit boundaries between different parts of the system, each with its own ubiquitous language and domain model.

**Implementation in Roboco:**
- Project management as a bounded context
- Agent orchestration as a separate bounded context
- Each context has its own models, repositories, and services

## Architectural Layers

### Domain Layer (Core)

Contains the domain models, business logic, and domain services.

**Implementation in Roboco:**
- `core/models/`: Core business entities with behavior
- `core/repositories/`: Interfaces defining persistence operations
- `core/schema/`: Data validation schemas for domain objects

### Application Layer

Coordinates the application tasks and delegates work to the domain layer.

**Implementation in Roboco:**
- `services/`: Application services that orchestrate domain operations
- `services/api_service.py`: Facade for the API layer to access domain functionality
- `services/task_service.py`: Manages task-related operations

### Infrastructure Layer

Provides technical capabilities to support the higher layers.

**Implementation in Roboco:**
- `infrastructure/repositories/`: Concrete implementations of repository interfaces
- `infrastructure/adapters/`: Adapters to convert between domain and external models

### Interface Layer

Handles interaction with external systems or users.

**Implementation in Roboco:**
- `api/`: FastAPI endpoints for HTTP interaction
- `api/schemas/`: Pydantic models for API validation and serialization
- `api/routers/`: Organized API endpoints by domain concept

## Design Patterns Used

### Repository Pattern

Provides an abstraction layer between the domain and data mapping layers.

**Implementation in Roboco:**
- `core/repositories/project_repository.py`: Interface defining persistence operations
- `infrastructure/repositories/file_project_repository.py`: Concrete implementation using file system

### Adapter Pattern

Converts interfaces between different components.

**Implementation in Roboco:**
- `infrastructure/adapters/pydantic_adapters.py`: Converts between domain models and Pydantic DTOs

### Dependency Injection

Provides dependencies to a class instead of having the class create them.

**Implementation in Roboco:**
- FastAPI dependency injection for services in API routers
- Service constructors accept repository interfaces

### Facade Pattern

Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

**Implementation in Roboco:**
- `services/api_service.py`: Provides a simplified interface to domain services for the API layer

## Benefits of DDD in Roboco

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to maintain
2. **Flexibility**: Domain model can evolve independently of infrastructure concerns
3. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation with mocked dependencies
4. **Business Alignment**: Code structure reflects the business domain
5. **Scalability**: Bounded contexts can be deployed and scaled independently

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

1. **Anemic Domain Model**: Models that are just data holders without behavior
2. **Smart UI, Dumb Domain**: Business logic in the UI or API layer instead of the domain
3. **Repository-Service Confusion**: Services that just delegate to repositories
4. **Leaky Abstractions**: Domain layer depending on infrastructure concerns

## Practical Guidelines

### When to Create a Domain Model

- When the entity has behavior beyond simple CRUD operations
- When there are business rules or invariants to enforce
- When the entity is a core business concept

### When to Use a Service

- When an operation doesn't naturally belong to a single entity
- When coordinating multiple entities in a business operation
- When integrating with external systems

### When to Create a Repository

- When a domain model needs persistence
- When you need to abstract the data access mechanism
- When you want to centralize query construction

## Migration Strategy

When migrating from a non-DDD architecture to DDD:

1. Identify domain concepts and create corresponding models
2. Extract business logic from existing code into domain models
3. Create repositories and services to orchestrate domain operations
4. Update API layer to use the new domain services
5. Gradually replace direct data access with repository calls

## Conclusion

Domain-Driven Design provides a structured approach to building complex software systems that align closely with business needs. In Roboco, DDD principles help create a maintainable, flexible, and business-focused codebase that can evolve with changing requirements.

By separating concerns into distinct layers and focusing on a rich domain model, Roboco achieves a clean architecture that is both powerful and comprehensible.
