## Our Philosophy

AgentX is built on a few core principles:

- **Autonomy**: Agents should be able to work towards a goal without constant human intervention.
- **Orchestration, not just Conversation**: We focus on the flow of work and tasks between agents, not just the exchange of messages.
- **Security by Default**: Untrusted code or commands generated by AI should run in a secure, sandboxed environment.
- **Developer Experience**: Building complex agent systems should be as simple and intuitive as possible, with clear configuration and a powerful API.
