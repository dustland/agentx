# Getting Started

AgentX is a Python framework for building multi-agent AI systems. Get started with these three progressive examples.

## Installation

```bash
pip install agentx-py
```

## 1. Single Agent (Simple Chat)

Let's start with the simplest possible AgentX setup - a single chat agent.

### Configuration

Create `team.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "simple_chat"
description: "A simple chat example with assistant"

agents:
  - name: "assistant"
    description: "Helpful AI assistant"
    prompt_template: "prompts/assistant.md"

execution:
  mode: "autonomous"
  initial_agent: "assistant"
  max_rounds: 10
  timeout_seconds: 300

memory:
  enabled: false
```

### Agent Prompt

Create `prompts/assistant.md`:

```markdown
# Helpful Assistant

You are a helpful AI assistant. Your goals:

- Answer questions clearly and accurately
- Be friendly and professional
- Use web search when you need current information
- Remember important details from our conversation

Always be helpful and honest about what you know and don't know.
```

### Python Code

Create `main.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from agentx.core.xagent import XAgent
from agentx.config.team_loader import load_team_config

async def main():
    config_path = Path(__file__).parent / "config" / "team.yaml"

    print("Chat started! Type 'quit' or 'q' to exit.")

    # Initialize XAgent for chat
    print("Initializing X...")
    team_config = load_team_config(str(config_path))
    x = XAgent(team_config=team_config)

    # Start the conversation loop
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ").strip()
        if user_input.lower() in ['quit', 'q']:
            break

        # Chat with X
        print("X: ", end="", flush=True)
        response = await x.chat(user_input)
        print(response.text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Environment Setup

Set your API key:

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Run It

```bash
python main.py
```

🎉 **Result:** You now have a working chat agent! This demonstrates the core AgentX conversational interface.

## 2. Multiple Agents with Tools (Auto Writer)

Now let's see the real power of AgentX - multiple specialized agents working together with tools.

### Configuration

Create `team.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "AutoWriter Production Team"
description: "A professional multi-agent system that produces superior, consulting-quality HTML reports"

# Enhanced orchestrator for multi-agent coordination
orchestrator:
  max_rounds: 50
  timeout: 1800

# All agents are presets from AgentX framework
agents:
  - "researcher" # Gathers and synthesizes rigorous, evidence-based research
  - "writer" # Transforms research into clear, persuasive narrative
  - "web_designer" # Architects the final, interactive HTML experience
  - "reviewer" # Provides final, uncompromising quality assurance

# Define how agents hand off work to each other
handoffs:
  - from_agent: "researcher"
    to_agent: "writer"
    condition: "When research is complete and writing is needed"
  - from_agent: "writer"
    to_agent: "web_designer"
    condition: "When the written content is complete and web design is needed"
  - from_agent: "web_designer"
    to_agent: "reviewer"
    condition: "When the web page is complete and review is needed"
```

### Python Code

Create `main.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from agentx import start_task

async def main():
    # Get the absolute path to the configuration file
    script_dir = Path(__file__).parent
    config_path = script_dir / "config" / "team.yaml"

    # The user's goal for the task
    prompt = "Generate a comprehensive and visually stunning report on the key trends shaping web development in 2025. The report must be an interactive HTML page, covering topics like new frontend frameworks, backend technologies, AI integration in development, and modern UX/UI design paradigms. The final output must be professional, polished, and suitable for a C-suite audience."

    print("🚀 AutoWriter - Starting comprehensive report generation...")
    print(f"📋 Task: {prompt[:100]}...")
    print("-" * 80)

    # Start the task with XAgent - creates a conversational interface
    x = await start_task(prompt, str(config_path))

    print(f"📋 Task ID: {x.task_id}")
    print(f"📁 Taskspace: {x.taskspace.get_taskspace_path()}")
    print("-" * 80)

    # Execute the task autonomously
    print("🤖 X: Starting the comprehensive report generation...")
    while not x.is_complete:
        response = await x.step()
        print(f"🤖 X: {response[:200]}...")
        print("-" * 40)

    print("\n✅ TASK COMPLETE")
    print(f"📁 Taskspace: {x.taskspace.get_taskspace_path()}")
    print(f"📋 Task ID: {x.task_id}")

    # Check for artifacts in the taskspace
    taskspace_path = x.taskspace.get_taskspace_path()
    artifacts_path = taskspace_path / "artifacts"

    if artifacts_path.exists():
        artifact_files = list(artifacts_path.glob("*"))
        if artifact_files:
            print(f"📄 Generated artifacts:")
            for artifact in artifact_files:
                print(f"   - {artifact.name}")

    print(f"\n🔗 Full taskspace path: {taskspace_path}")
    print("📁 Check the taskspace directory for the generated report and artifacts.")

    # Demonstrate conversational interaction
    print("\n💬 You can also chat with X to modify the report:")
    print("   Example: await x.chat('Make the report more visual with charts')")
    print("   Example: await x.chat('Add a section about security trends')")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Run It

```bash
python main.py
```

🎉 **Result:** You now have a complete multi-agent system that:

- **Researcher** gathers comprehensive information using web search
- **Writer** creates compelling content from research
- **Web Designer** builds professional HTML with interactive features
- **Reviewer** ensures quality and polish
- **Orchestrator** coordinates the entire workflow automatically

The agents work together seamlessly, each using their specialized tools and capabilities.
