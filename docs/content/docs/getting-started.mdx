## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing AgentX, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.11 or higher**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- An **API key** from a supported LLM provider

### Install AgentX

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install agentx-py

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/dustland/agentx.git
cd agentx
pip install -e .
```

### Verify Installation

```python
import agentx
print(f"AgentX version: {agentx.__version__}")
```

## Quick Start

Let's create your first AgentX agent in just a few minutes!

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Create a new project
mkdir my-agentx-project
cd my-agentx-project

# Create the basic structure
mkdir -p config/prompts
mkdir workspace
```

### 2. Get an API Key

AgentX supports multiple LLM providers. For this example, we'll use DeepSeek (free tier available):

1. Visit [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Generate an API key
4. Set your environment variable:

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Create Your First Agent

Create `config/team.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "my_first_agent"
description: "My first AgentX agent"

agents:
  - name: "assistant"
    description: "Helpful AI assistant"
    prompt_template: "prompts/assistant.md"
    tools: []
    llm_config:
      provider: "deepseek"
      model: "deepseek-chat"
      temperature: 0.7
      max_tokens: 4000

tools: []

execution:
  mode: "autonomous"
  initial_agent: "assistant"
  max_rounds: 10
  timeout_seconds: 300

memory:
  enabled: false
```

### 4. Define Your Agent's Behavior

Create `config/prompts/assistant.md`:

```markdown
# Helpful Assistant

You are a helpful AI assistant created with AgentX. Your role is to:

- Answer questions clearly and accurately
- Be friendly and professional
- Help users understand complex topics
- Admit when you don't know something

## Guidelines

- Keep responses concise but thorough
- Use examples when helpful
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Always be respectful and helpful
```

### 5. Create the Application

Create `main.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from agentx.core.task import TaskExecutor

async def main():
    print("ü§ñ My First AgentX Agent")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit\n")

    config_path = Path(__file__).parent / "config" / "team.yaml"
    task_executor = TaskExecutor(str(config_path))

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ").strip()
        if user_input.lower() in ['quit', 'q', 'exit']:
            print("Goodbye! üëã")
            break

        print("Assistant: ", end="", flush=True)
        async for chunk in task_executor.execute_task(user_input, stream=True):
            if chunk.get("type") == "content":
                print(chunk.get("content", ""), end="", flush=True)
        print("\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### 6. Run Your Agent

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see:

```
ü§ñ My First AgentX Agent
Type 'quit' to exit

You: Hello!
Assistant: Hello! I'm your AgentX assistant. How can I help you today?

You:
```

üéâ **Congratulations!** You've just created your first AgentX agent!

## Core Concepts

Understanding these key concepts will help you build more sophisticated systems:

### Agents

Agents are the core building blocks of AgentX. Each agent has:

- **Identity**: Name and description
- **Behavior**: Defined by prompt templates
- **Capabilities**: Tools they can use
- **Configuration**: LLM settings and parameters

### Teams

Teams are collections of agents that work together:

- **Coordination**: Agents can hand off tasks to each other
- **Specialization**: Each agent can have different roles
- **Orchestration**: Automatic routing and task management

### Tools

Tools extend what agents can do:

- **Built-in Tools**: Memory, handoffs, web search
- **Custom Tools**: Build your own integrations
- **External APIs**: Connect to databases, services, etc.

### Memory

Memory enables agents to remember context:

- **Short-term**: Within a conversation
- **Long-term**: Across multiple sessions
- **Shared**: Between multiple agents

## Project Structure

A typical AgentX project follows this structure:

```
my-agentx-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team.yaml           # Team configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts/            # Agent prompt templates
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent1.md
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ agent2.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/                  # Custom tools (optional)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_tool.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workspace/              # Agent workspace
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                 # Application entry point
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt        # Dependencies
```

## Configuration Overview

AgentX uses YAML configuration files to define your agent systems:

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
name: "my_system"
description: "Description of what this system does"

# Define your agents
agents:
  - name: "agent_name"
    description: "What this agent does"
    prompt_template: "prompts/agent.md"
    tools: ["tool1", "tool2"]
    llm_config:
      provider: "deepseek"
      model: "deepseek-chat"
      temperature: 0.7

# Define available tools
tools:
  - name: "tool1"
    type: "builtin"

# Execution settings
execution:
  mode: "autonomous"
  initial_agent: "agent_name"
  max_rounds: 10
```

### Advanced Features

```yaml
# Multi-agent coordination
orchestrator:
  max_rounds: 20
  timeout: 600
  brain_config:
    model: "deepseek/deepseek-chat"
    temperature: 0.0

# Memory configuration
memory:
  enabled: true
  backend: "mem0"
  config:
    vector_store:
      provider: "qdrant"

# Workspace settings
workspace:
  base_path: "workspace"
  auto_cleanup: false
```

## LLM Provider Support

AgentX supports multiple LLM providers:

### DeepSeek (Recommended for beginners)

```yaml
llm_config:
  provider: "deepseek"
  model: "deepseek-chat"
  base_url: "https://api.deepseek.com"
```

### OpenAI

```yaml
llm_config:
  provider: "openai"
  model: "gpt-4"
```

### Claude

```yaml
llm_config:
  provider: "anthropic"
  model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229"
```

### Local Models

```yaml
llm_config:
  provider: "ollama"
  model: "llama2"
  base_url: "http://localhost:11434"
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Design

- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have a clear, focused role
- **Clear Prompts**: Write specific, detailed prompt templates
- **Appropriate Tools**: Give agents only the tools they need
- **Proper Temperature**: Use lower values for focused tasks, higher for creative work

### Configuration Management

- **Version Control**: Keep your configuration files in version control
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
- **Documentation**: Document your agent roles and workflows
- **Testing**: Test your agents with various inputs

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle API failures gracefully
- **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging
- **Monitoring**: Monitor agent performance and behavior
- **Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for long-running tasks

## Common Patterns

### Single Agent Pattern

Perfect for simple assistants and chatbots:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "assistant"
    # Single agent configuration
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

For complex workflows requiring specialization:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "researcher"
    tools: ["web_search", "handoff"]
  - name: "writer"
    tools: ["handoff", "file_ops"]
```

### Tool-Heavy Agents

For agents that need external capabilities:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "data_agent"
    tools: ["database", "api_client", "file_ops"]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent not responding?**

- Check your API key is set correctly
- Verify your internet connection
- Look at the logs for error messages

**Configuration errors?**

- Validate your YAML syntax
- Check file paths are correct
- Ensure all required fields are present

**Tool not working?**

- Verify tool is properly configured
- Check tool dependencies are installed
- Review tool implementation for errors
