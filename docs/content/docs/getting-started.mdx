# Getting Started with VibeX

Welcome to VibeX! This guide will walk you through the basics of setting up your first multi-agent team.

## Installation

First, make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, you can install VibeX using pip:

```bash
pip install vibex
```

## Your First Agent Team

Let's create a simple agent team with a writer and a reviewer.

### 1. Configure Your Team

Create a `team.yaml` file to define your agents:

```yaml
# team.yaml
agents:
  - name: writer
    description: "A professional writer who creates high-quality content."
    prompt_file: "writer.md"
  - name: reviewer
    description: "A meticulous reviewer who checks for clarity and accuracy."
    prompt_file: "reviewer.md"
```

### 2. Create Agent Prompts

Create the prompt files for your agents:

```markdown
# writer.md

You are a professional writer. Your task is to create a well-structured and engaging article based on the user's request.
```

```markdown
# reviewer.md

You are a meticulous reviewer. Your task is to review the writer's work for clarity, accuracy, and overall quality. Provide feedback for improvement.
```

### 3. Run Your Team

Now, you can use VibeX to run your agent team. Create a Python script:

```python
import asyncio
from vibex import XAgent

async def main():
    # Start a new project
    x = await XAgent.start(
        goal="Write a short blog post about the benefits of remote work.",
        config_path="team.yaml"
    )

    # Autonomously execute the project
    while not x.is_complete():
        response = await x.step()
        print(response)

    print("Project completed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

<Callout type="info">
  When you run this script, VibeX will orchestrate the writer and reviewer
  agents to collaboratively create and refine the blog post.
</Callout>
