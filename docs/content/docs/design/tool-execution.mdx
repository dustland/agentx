# Tool Call and Execution

## 1. Overview and Core Principles

This document details the architecture for defining, executing, and managing tools within AgentX. It is designed to be secure, robust, and extensible. The core principles are:

- **Security First**: Untrusted code (LLM-generated shell commands) must never execute directly on the host machine. All tool execution is centralized and sandboxed.
- **Robust Self-Correction**: LLM-generated tool calls can be malformed. The system must be able to detect this, provide corrective feedback to the LLM, and allow it to fix its own mistakes.
- **Structured and Extensible**: All tools are strongly-typed and their schemas are automatically generated. The system is designed to easily accommodate new types of tools, including custom user-defined functions and external integrations.

## 2. Tool Definition and Registration

A "tool" is a capability that an agent can call. This can be a Python function or a shell command.

### 2.1. Tool Definition

- **Python Functions**: Any Python function can be turned into a tool. The function must have type hints for all its arguments and a clear docstring. The docstring is critical as it is used in the prompt to tell the agent what the tool does.

  ```python
  def write_file(path: str, content: str) -> str:
      """Writes content to a file at the specified path."""
      # ... implementation ...
      return f"File '{path}' written successfully."
  ```

- **Shell Commands**: Shell commands are defined with a name, description, and an argument schema. The agent's LLM will generate the command string based on the arguments.

### 2.2. Tool Registration and Schema Generation

Tools are made available to agents via a central `ToolRegistry`.

- **Decorator-Based Registration**: The `@register_tool` decorator is the primary mechanism for adding a tool to the registry.

  ```python
  from agentx.core.tool import register_tool

  @register_tool
  def write_file(path: str, content: str) -> str:
      # ...
  ```

- **Automatic Schema Generation**: When a function is decorated, the `ToolRegistry` automatically inspects its signature and docstring to create a JSON schema. This schema is what the LLM sees and uses to construct a valid tool call. For the `write_file` example, the generated schema would look like this:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "write_file",
    "description": "Writes content to a file at the specified path.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "path": { "type": "string" },
        "content": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["path", "content"]
    }
  }
  ```

## 3. The Tool Call Lifecycle

The following diagram and steps describe the end-to-end flow of a tool call, from the `Lead`'s instruction to the final result.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Orchestration"
        LEAD[Lead]
    end

    subgraph "Agent"
        A["Brain (LLM)"]
        B["Agent Core"]
    end

    subgraph "Task Executor"
        TM["ToolManager"]
    end

    subgraph "Execution"
        TOOL["Tool<br/>(e.g., Python function)"]
    end

    LEAD -- "1. Assign micro-task<br/>(e.g., 'Write content to file')" --> A
    A -- "2. Generate tool call" --> B
    B -- "3. Execute via ToolManager" --> TM

    alt 4a. Validation Fails
        TM -- "Validation Error" --> B
        B -- "Error context" --> A
        A -- "Corrected tool call" --> B
        B -- "Retry execution" --> TM
    end

    TM -- "4b. Validation Succeeds" --> TOOL
    TOOL -- "5. Return result" --> TM
    TM -- "6. Return structured result" --> B
    B -- "7. Return completed task to Lead" --> LEAD
```

**Step-by-Step Flow:**

1.  **Task Assignment (Lead)**: The process begins when the `Lead` agent, following its master plan, assigns a single, specific task to a specialist `Agent` (e.g., "Write 'hello world' to `hello.txt`").

2.  **Tool Call Generation (Agent Brain)**: The `Agent`'s `Brain` (LLM) receives the simple instruction. Since the task directly maps to a tool, it generates the corresponding tool call (e.g., `write_file(path='hello.txt', content='hello world')`).

3.  **Direct Execution (Agent Core)**: The `Agent`'s core logic parses the tool call and passes it to the `ToolManager` for execution.

4.  **Validation (ToolManager)**: The `ToolManager` validates the call against the tool's registered schema.

    - **If Validation Fails**: The `ToolManager` returns a structured error to the `Agent`. The `Agent` passes the error back to its `Brain`, which generates a corrected call. This simple, powerful self-correction loop is a core feature of the framework.
    - **If Validation Succeeds**: The `ToolManager` proceeds to execution.

5.  **Secure Execution (ToolExecutor)**: The `ToolManager`'s internal `ToolExecutor` securely runs the tool. For a Python function, it is called directly. For a shell command, it is run inside a secure sandbox.

6.  **Result Capturing**: The `ToolExecutor` captures the return value or output of the tool and packages it into a structured `ToolResult` object, which is passed back to the `Agent`.

7.  **Task Completion**: The `Agent` has now completed its assigned micro-task. It returns the `ToolResult` to the `Lead`, which then updates its master plan and decides on the next step in the overall workflow.

## 4. Security Architecture: The Sandbox

Executing arbitrary, LLM-generated shell commands is a major security risk. AgentX mitigates this by using a sandboxed execution environment.

- **Technology**: The default implementation uses **Docker containers**. Each shell tool execution spins up a new, short-lived container.
- **Isolation**:
  - **Network**: Containers run with networking disabled by default (`--net=none`) to prevent exfiltration of data or attacks on the local network. Tools that explicitly need network access must be granted it.
  - **Filesystem**: The container is only granted access to the current task's workspace directory (`/app/workspace`). It cannot read from or write to any other part of the host filesystem.
  - **Permissions**: The process inside the container runs as a non-root user to limit its privileges even within the sandbox.

## 5. Extensibility

### 5.1. Custom and Built-in Tools

- **Built-in Tools**: AgentX provides a core set of safe tools for file I/O, search, etc., located in `src/agentx/builtin_tools/`.
- **Custom Tools**: Users can easily define their own tools in their project's codebase. As long as the file is imported and the functions are decorated with `@register_tool`, they will be available to the agents.

### 5.2. MCP (Multi-Agent Communication Protocol) Integration

The tool architecture is extensible to other protocols. An MCP tool could be implemented as a special Python function:

```python
@register_tool
def send_mcp_message(recipient_agent: str, message_body: str):
    """Sends a message to another agent using the MCP protocol."""
    # Logic to connect to MCP broker and send message
    # ...
```

To the `Orchestrator` and `Agent`, this is just another tool. The implementation details are abstracted away.
