# AgentX Design & Architecture

Welcome to the AgentX design documentation! This section provides comprehensive technical insights into how AgentX works internally, its architectural decisions, and the principles that guide its development.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

AgentX is built as a lightweight micro-kernel that orchestrates specialized agents in a secure, observable, and scalable manner. The system transforms complex user requests into coordinated multi-agent workflows with complete auditability.

### Key Design Principles

- **Separation of Concerns** - Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Centralized Orchestration** - Unified control plane for coordination and security
- **Agent Autonomy** - Agents manage their own reasoning with private Brains
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Asynchronous, structured communication
- **Configuration-Driven** - Declarative team and workflow definitions
- **Security by Design** - Audited, policy-enforced external interactions
- **Workspace Isolation** - Version-controlled, reproducible task environments

## üìö Design Documentation

### [System Architecture](/design/overview)

Complete architectural overview covering the four-layer system design, collaboration models, and execution patterns. Includes detailed sequence diagrams and component interactions.

### [State and Context Management](/design/state-and-context)

Deep dive into how AgentX manages state, context, and memory across agents and tasks. Covers workspace isolation, memory systems, and context propagation.

### [Tool Execution](/design/tool-execution)

Detailed explanation of the secure tool execution system, including validation, sandboxing, and the tool self-correction mechanism that enables reliable agent tool usage.

### [Communication Patterns](/design/communication)

Event-driven communication architecture, message passing patterns, and how agents coordinate through the orchestrator and event bus.

## üéØ Key Architectural Components

### TaskExecutor

The primary workflow engine that owns the end-to-end lifecycle of tasks, manages workspace provisioning, and coordinates agent invocations.

### Orchestrator

Centralized service for tool management and validation. Handles tool-call requests, schema validation, and secure dispatch to the ToolExecutor.

### Agent & Brain

Specialized agents with private reasoning capabilities. Each agent encapsulates a role and uses its Brain (LLM) for autonomous decision-making.

### Platform Services

Shared, pluggable services including the Event Bus, Memory System, Configuration Management, and Observability infrastructure.

## üîÑ Execution Modes

AgentX supports two primary execution patterns:

- **Autonomous Execution** - Fire-and-forget mode ideal for production workflows
- **Interactive Execution** - Step-by-step control for debugging and human-in-the-loop scenarios

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Observability

Every interaction in AgentX is:

- **Auditable** - Complete event logging of all decisions and actions
- **Secure** - Sandboxed tool execution with policy enforcement
- **Observable** - Real-time monitoring and debugging capabilities
- **Reproducible** - Version-controlled workspaces and deterministic execution
