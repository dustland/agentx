# Multi-Tenant Architecture

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE**
>
> This multi-tenant implementation provides **organizational isolation only**, not true security isolation. Users can pass any `user_id` parameter to access other users' taskspaces and data. This design is suitable for trusted environments and development scenarios, but **requires external authentication and authorization layers** for production security. See the [Authentication Integration](#authentication-integration) section for secure deployment patterns.

VibeX provides multi-tenant support through a clean layered architecture that separates user management from the core task execution framework. This design ensures that different users can logically separate their work when sharing the same VibeX instance, while keeping the framework pure and reusable.

## Overview

Multi-tenancy in VibeX is implemented through a clean three-layer architecture that separates concerns:

1. **API Layer**: Thin HTTP wrapper handling authentication and user context
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic managing user-task relationships and permissions
3. **Framework Layer**: Pure task execution engine (user-agnostic)

### Architectural Decision: User-Agnostic Framework

After careful consideration, we decided to keep the core framework (XAgent, Task, Storage) completely user-agnostic. This decision was made for several important reasons:

#### Why the Framework Should NOT Know About Users

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separating user concerns from task execution creates a cleaner, more maintainable architecture with clear boundaries between layers.

2. **Framework Reusability**: A user-agnostic framework can be easily reused in different contexts - single-user CLI tools, embedded systems, or multi-tenant servers - without modification.

3. **Simplified Testing**: Testing the framework becomes much simpler when it doesn't need to mock user contexts or authentication systems.

4. **Security Through Separation**: By handling user authentication and authorization entirely in the service layer, we avoid accidentally exposing user data through the framework APIs.

5. **Flexibility**: Different deployment scenarios can implement their own user management strategies without modifying the core framework.

### Key Security Principles

- **User Isolation**: User-task relationships managed entirely by the service layer
- **Clean Boundaries**: Framework has no knowledge of users, only tasks
- **Service Layer Security**: All user validation and permission checks in one place
- **API Authentication**: User context derived from authenticated sessions

> **Note**: These principles provide organizational separation but do not prevent malicious users from accessing other users' data by manipulating the `user_id` parameter. Production deployments must implement proper authentication and authorization.

## Taskspace Isolation Design

### Directory Structure

With our user-agnostic framework design, the storage structure is simplified:

```
task_data/
├── {task_id}/
│   ├── artifacts/          # Task files
│   ├── logs/              # Execution logs
│   ├── messages/          # Conversation history
│   └── plan.json          # Task execution plan
└── {another_task_id}/
    └── ...
```

User-task relationships are maintained separately by the service layer:

```
user_index/
├── {user_id}.json         # List of task IDs owned by user
└── _task_index.json       # Reverse mapping: task_id → user_id
```

This separation ensures the framework remains pure while the service layer handles all user-related concerns.

## API Security Model

### User-Scoped Endpoints

All task-related endpoints require `user_id` for proper isolation:

```http
# Create user-scoped task
POST /tasks
{
  "config_path": "config/team.yaml",
  "task_description": "Build a website",
  "user_id": "alice"
}

# List user's tasks only
GET /tasks?user_id=alice

# Access user's task data (user_id passed via header or auth context)
GET /tasks/{task_id}
GET /tasks/{task_id}/artifacts
```

### Permission Enforcement

- **Task Creation**: Tasks are created with user_id association
- **Task Listing**: Results filtered by user_id parameter
- **Task Access**: 404 returned for tasks not owned by requesting user
- **Artifact Access**: File system access limited to user's taskspace

> **Security Limitation**: The current implementation trusts the provided `user_id` parameter without validation. Any user can access another user's data by providing their `user_id`. This requires external authentication middleware to validate user identity and enforce proper access controls.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### Clean Layer Architecture

```python
# Framework Layer - User-agnostic
class XAgent:
    def __init__(self, team_config, task_id=None):
        # No user_id - framework doesn't know about users
        self.task_id = task_id or generate_short_id()
        self.taskspace = TaskspaceFactory.create_taskspace(
            base_path=Path("./task_data"),
            task_id=self.task_id
        )

# Service Layer - Manages user-task relationships
class TaskService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_index = get_user_task_index()  # File or Redis backend

    async def create_task(self, user_id: str, prompt: str, config_path: str):
        # Create task without user context
        task = await start_task(prompt=prompt, config_path=config_path)

        # Map task to user in service layer
        await self.user_index.add_task(user_id, task.task_id)
        return task

    async def get_task(self, user_id: str, task_id: str):
        # Verify ownership before returning task
        if not await self.user_index.user_owns_task(user_id, task_id):
            raise PermissionError("Access denied")

        # Resume task without user context
        return await resume_task(task_id)

# API Layer - Thin HTTP wrapper
@app.post("/tasks")
async def create_task(request: TaskRequest, x_user_id: str = Header(None)):
    if not x_user_id:
        raise HTTPException(401, "User ID required")

    # Delegate to service layer
    task_info = await task_service.create_task(
        user_id=x_user_id,
        prompt=request.task_description,
        config_path=request.config_path
    )
```

### API Models

Task-related models require `user_id` fields:

```python
class TaskRequest(BaseModel):
    config_path: str
    task_description: str
    user_id: str  # Required multi-tenant identifier

class TaskResponse(BaseModel):
    task_id: str
    status: TaskStatus
    user_id: str  # Always returned for verification
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Isolation

- **File System**: Complete directory separation by user_id
- **Memory**: Task storage scoped to prevent cross-user access
- **Artifacts**: Git versioning isolated per user taskspace
- **Logs**: Execution logs stored in user-specific directories

> **Critical**: These isolation mechanisms only work when the correct `user_id` is provided. Without proper authentication, users can bypass all isolation by using other users' IDs.

### Path Traversal Protection

The taskspace system includes built-in protection against path traversal attacks:

```python
# Safe: resolves to taskspace/alice/task123/file.txt
taskspace.get_artifact("file.txt")

# Blocked: attempts to access ../bob/task456/ are prevented
# by Path.resolve() and taskspace boundary checks
```

> **Note**: Path traversal protection only works within the specified user's taskspace. Users can still access other users' taskspaces by providing different `user_id` values.

### Resource Limits

While basic isolation is provided, production deployments should implement:

- **Authentication**: Validate user identity before accepting `user_id` parameter
- **Authorization**: Ensure users can only access their own resources
- **Disk quotas** per user
- **Rate limiting** on API endpoints
- **Memory limits** for task execution
- **Concurrent task limits** per user

## Deployment Patterns

### Multi-Tenant Mode (Default)

```bash
# Start VibeX with multi-tenant support
vibex start

# All tasks require user_id for isolated taskspaces
POST /tasks {"user_id": "alice", "config_path": "config.yaml", "task_description": "..."}
```

> **⚠️ SECURITY WARNING**: The above example shows the API structure but is NOT secure. In production, the `user_id` must be derived from authenticated sessions, not passed as a parameter. Direct API access without authentication allows any user to access any other user's data.

### Authentication Integration

VibeX's multi-tenancy requires integration with authentication systems:

> **REQUIRED FOR SECURITY**: The examples below show how to implement proper authentication and authorization. Without this middleware, the multi-tenant system provides no security protection.

```python
# Example: JWT-based user identification
from jwt import decode

async def get_current_user(authorization: str = Header(None)):
    if not authorization:
        raise HTTPException(401, "Authentication required")

    token = authorization.replace("Bearer ", "")
    payload = decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
    user_id = payload.get("user_id")

    if not user_id:
        raise HTTPException(401, "Invalid token")

    return user_id

@app.post("/tasks")
async def create_task(request: TaskRequest, user_id: str = Depends(get_current_user)):
    request.user_id = user_id  # Set authenticated user
    # ... create task
```

> **Security Note**: The `user_id` must come from the authenticated session, never from user input. Any endpoint that accepts `user_id` as a parameter without authentication is a security vulnerability.

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Ensure user_id is always provided** from authenticated context
2. **Validate user permissions** at the application layer
3. **Use HTTPS** for API communication
4. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
5. **Monitor resource usage** per user

### Performance

1. **Clean up old taskspaces** periodically
2. **Implement disk quotas** to prevent storage exhaustion
3. **Consider task archival** for long-term storage
4. **Monitor concurrent tasks** per user

### Monitoring

1. **Track taskspace sizes** per user
2. **Monitor API access patterns** for anomalies
3. **Log security events** (unauthorized access attempts)
4. **Set up alerts** for resource threshold breaches

## Example Implementation

### Complete Multi-Tenant Setup

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, Header
from vibex.server.api import create_app
from vibex.server.models import TaskRequest

app = create_app()

# API key based authentication (required)
async def get_current_user(api_key: str = Header(None)):
    if not api_key:
        raise HTTPException(401, "API key required")

    # Validate API key and return user_id
    user_id = validate_api_key(api_key)
    if not user_id:
        raise HTTPException(401, "Invalid API key")

    return user_id

@app.post("/tasks")
async def create_task(
    request: TaskRequest,
    user_id: str = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    # Ensure user_id from authentication
    request.user_id = user_id
    return await create_task_endpoint(request)

@app.get("/tasks")
async def list_tasks(user_id: str = Depends(get_current_user)):
    return await list_tasks(user_id=user_id)
```

## Benefits of the User-Agnostic Framework Design

Our decision to keep the framework user-agnostic provides several key benefits:

### 1. Deployment Flexibility

The same framework can be used in multiple contexts without modification:

```python
# CLI usage - no user context needed
x = await start_task("Build a website", "config.yaml")

# Server usage - service layer adds user context
task = await task_service.create_task(user_id, "Build a website", "config.yaml")

# Embedded usage - integrate into existing applications
agent = XAgent(config, task_id="custom-123")
```

### 2. Simplified Testing

Framework tests don't need to mock user systems:

```python
# Clean framework tests
async def test_task_execution():
    task = await start_task("Test task", test_config)
    assert task.is_complete

# Service layer tests handle user concerns separately
async def test_user_task_ownership():
    task = await service.create_task("user1", "Task", config)
    assert await service.user_owns_task("user1", task.task_id)
    assert not await service.user_owns_task("user2", task.task_id)
```

### 3. Clear Security Boundaries

All user-related security is handled in one place (service layer), making it easier to audit and maintain:

- Authentication: API layer
- Authorization: Service layer
- Execution: Framework layer (no user knowledge)

### 4. Future Extensibility

New deployment patterns can be added without modifying the core:

- Team-based access control
- Role-based permissions
- External identity providers
- Custom authorization rules

This multi-tenant architecture provides organizational separation that enables VibeX to be deployed in shared environments with proper external authentication. By keeping the framework user-agnostic, we maintain maximum flexibility while ensuring clean separation of concerns. The framework itself does not provide security isolation - it relies on external authentication systems to validate user identity and enforce access controls through the service layer. When properly secured with authentication middleware, this design maintains the simplicity and flexibility that makes VibeX easy to use and deploy.
