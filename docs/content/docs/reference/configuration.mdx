# Configuration Reference

This guide provides a comprehensive reference for configuring AgentX teams using YAML files. AgentX uses a declarative configuration approach that allows you to define agent teams, their capabilities, and collaboration patterns without writing code.

## Configuration Structure

The top-level configuration file defines a team of agents and their collaboration settings. Here's the complete schema:

```yaml
# Team identification
name: "Your Team Name" # Required: A descriptive name for your team
description: "Team description" # Optional: What this team does

# Taskspace configuration
output_dir: "taskspace" # Optional: Where to store outputs (default: "taskspace")

# Agent definitions
agents: # Required: List of agents in the team
  - "researcher" # Can be preset names (strings)
  - name: "custom_agent" # Or detailed agent configurations
    description: "Custom agent"
    prompt_file: "prompts/custom.md"
    tools: ["web_search", "write_file"]

# Agent collaboration
handoffs: # Optional: Define agent handoff rules
  - from_agent: "researcher"
    to_agent: "writer"
    condition: "When research is complete"
    priority: 1 # Optional: Higher = higher priority

# Advanced configurations
collaboration_patterns: [] # Optional: Custom collaboration patterns
tools: [] # Optional: Custom tool definitions
guardrail_policies: [] # Optional: Safety and compliance rules
memory: {} # Optional: Memory system configuration
execution: {} # Optional: Task execution settings
orchestrator: {} # Optional: Orchestrator (X) configuration
deployment_config: {} # Optional: Deployment-specific settings
```

## Core Configuration Options

### Team Metadata

```yaml
name: "AutoWriter Production Team" # Required
description: "Professional research and writing system" # Optional
output_dir: "reports" # Optional (default: "taskspace")
```

### Agent Configuration

Agents can be defined in three ways:

#### 1. Preset Agents (Recommended)

Use built-in agent presets by name:

```yaml
agents:
  - "researcher" # Evidence-based research specialist
  - "writer" # Professional content creator
  - "web_designer" # HTML/CSS expert
  - "reviewer" # Quality assurance specialist
  - "developer" # Software engineer
```

#### 2. Custom Agent Configuration

Define custom agents with specific settings:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "data_analyst"
    description: "Analyzes datasets and creates visualizations"
    prompt_file: "prompts/analyst.md" # Path to prompt file
    tools: ["read_file", "python_repl", "create_chart"]
    brain_config:
      model: "gpt-4"
      temperature: 0.3
    memory_config:
      enabled: true
      max_context_tokens: 4000
```

#### 3. Inline System Message

For simple agents, define the prompt directly:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: "translator"
    description: "Translates content between languages"
    system_message: |
      You are a professional translator. Your task is to accurately
      translate content while preserving meaning and cultural context.
    tools: ["read_file", "write_file"]
```

### Handoff Configuration

Define when and how agents pass work to each other:

```yaml
handoffs:
  - from_agent: "researcher"
    to_agent: "writer"
    condition: "When comprehensive research is gathered and ready for writing"
    priority: 1 # Higher priority handoffs are evaluated first

  - from_agent: "writer"
    to_agent: "reviewer"
    condition: "When content is complete and needs quality review"
    priority: 2
```

### Brain Configuration

Configure the LLM settings for agents or the orchestrator:

```yaml
# Team-level default
llm_provider:
  provider: "openai" # Options: openai, anthropic, deepseek, ollama
  model: "gpt-4" # Model name
  temperature: 0.7 # 0.0-2.0, controls randomness
  max_tokens: 8000 # Maximum response length
  api_key: null # Optional: Override env variable
  base_url: null # Optional: Custom endpoint
  timeout: 30 # Request timeout in seconds
  streaming: true # Enable streaming responses

# Agent-specific override
agents:
  - name: "precise_analyst"
    brain_config:
      model: "gpt-4"
      temperature: 0.1 # Lower temperature for more deterministic output
      max_tokens: 4000
```

### Memory Configuration

Control how agents remember and use context:

```yaml
memory:
  enabled: true # Enable memory system
  max_context_tokens: 8000 # Maximum context window
  semantic_search_enabled: true # Enable semantic memory search
  short_term_limit: 10000 # Short-term memory token limit
  long_term_enabled: true # Enable long-term memory
  consolidation_interval: 3600 # Memory consolidation interval (seconds)
  vector_db_config: # Vector database settings
    provider: "chroma"
    collection_name: "agent_memory"
```

### Tool Configuration

Define custom tools for agents:

```yaml
tools:
  - name: "data_processor"
    type: "python_function" # Options: python_function, shell_script, mcp_tool, builtin
    description: "Process CSV data files"
    source: "tools/data_processor.py"
    function: "process_data"
    parameters: # JSON Schema for parameters
      type: "object"
      properties:
        file_path:
          type: "string"
          description: "Path to CSV file"
      required: ["file_path"]

  - name: "api_client"
    type: "mcp_tool"
    server_url: "http://localhost:8080"
    timeout: 30
```

### Execution Configuration

Control how tasks are executed:

```yaml
execution:
  mode: "autonomous" # Options: autonomous, step_through
  max_rounds: 10 # Maximum conversation rounds
  timeout_seconds: 300 # Task timeout
  initial_agent: "researcher" # Starting agent
  step_through_enabled: false # Enable step-by-step mode
  breakpoints: # Pause execution at these points
    - "after_research"
    - "before_final_review"
  success_criteria: # Define success conditions
    - "HTML report generated"
    - "All tests pass"
  failure_criteria: # Define failure conditions
    - "API rate limit exceeded"
    - "Critical error encountered"
```

### Orchestrator Configuration

Configure the orchestrator (X) that manages agent coordination:

```yaml
orchestrator:
  brain_config:
    provider: "deepseek"
    model: "deepseek-chat"
    temperature: 0.3 # Lower for more consistent planning
    max_tokens: 8000
    timeout: 120
  max_rounds: 50 # Maximum orchestration rounds
  timeout: 3600 # Total orchestration timeout
```

### Collaboration Patterns

Define custom collaboration workflows:

```yaml
collaboration_patterns:
  - name: "peer_review"
    type: "parallel" # Options: sequential, parallel, consensus, dynamic
    agents: ["writer_1", "writer_2", "editor"]
    coordination_agent: "editor" # Agent that coordinates the pattern
    config:
      min_consensus: 2 # Minimum agreements needed
      timeout: 600 # Pattern timeout
```

### Guardrail Policies

Implement safety and compliance rules:

```yaml
guardrail_policies:
  - name: "content_safety"
    type: "content_filter" # Options: input_validation, output_filtering, rate_limiting, content_safety
    severity: "high" # Options: low, medium, high
    action: "block" # Options: block, warn, log
    rules:
      - type: "regex"
        pattern: "\\b(password|secret|key)\\b"
        message: "Sensitive information detected"
      - type: "length"
        max_length: 10000
        message: "Content too long"
```

## Advanced Features

### Context Variables

Share dynamic context between agents:

```yaml
context_variables:
  project_name: "Q4 Report"
  target_audience: "C-suite executives"
  brand_guidelines_url: "https://example.com/brand"

agents:
  - name: "writer"
    system_message: |
      Write for {target_audience} about {project_name}.
      Follow guidelines at {brand_guidelines_url}.
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration

Use environment variables for sensitive data:

```yaml
llm_provider:
  provider: "${LLM_PROVIDER:-openai}"
  api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
  model: "${LLM_MODEL:-gpt-4}"
```

### Deployment Configuration

Add deployment-specific settings:

```yaml
deployment_config:
  environment: "production"
  logging_level: "INFO"
  metrics_enabled: true
  api_endpoints:
    webhook_url: "https://api.example.com/webhook"
  resource_limits:
    max_memory: "2GB"
    max_cpu: "2.0"
```

## Complete Example

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with preset agents and basic handoffs, then add complexity as needed.

2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose clear, descriptive names for agents and tools that reflect their purpose.

3. **Define Clear Handoff Conditions**: Write handoff conditions in natural language that clearly describe when transfers should occur.

4. **Leverage Presets**: Use built-in agent presets when possible - they're optimized and well-tested.

5. **Version Control**: Keep your configuration files in version control to track changes over time.

6. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive data like API keys.

7. **Test Incrementally**: Test your configuration with simple tasks before deploying complex workflows.

8. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Set appropriate timeouts and token limits to control costs and prevent runaway processes.

## Validation

AgentX validates your configuration at startup. Common validation errors include:

- Missing required fields (name, agents)
- Invalid agent references in handoffs
- Circular handoff dependencies
- Invalid tool configurations
- Unsupported model or provider names

Run `agentx validate <config.yaml>` to check your configuration before use.
