# Glossary

A comprehensive reference for AgentX terminology and concepts.

## A

### Agent

An AI assistant with specific roles and capabilities. Agents can be preset (built-in specialists) or custom (defined with your own prompts and tools).

### Agent Types

- **Preset Agents**: Built-in specialists like researcher, writer, web_designer, reviewer
- **Custom Agents**: Define your own with custom prompts and tools
- **Tool-Heavy Agents**: Agents with extensive external integrations

### Autonomous Mode

Execution mode where agents work independently without human intervention until completion or explicit stopping condition.

## B

### Bootstrap

AgentX's project wizard (`agentx init`) that creates complete, working projects with intelligent defaults.

### Brain

The LLM-powered reasoning engine that drives agent decision-making and responses.

## C

### Configuration

YAML files that define agent teams, their roles, tools, and coordination patterns.

### Coordination Patterns

Different ways agents can work together:

- **Single Agent**: Direct conversation
- **Sequential Handoffs**: Agents pass work to next specialist
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Agents pause for human input/approval

## E

### Execution Mode

How agents operate:

- **Autonomous**: Agents work independently
- **Interactive**: Human guidance at each step
- **Hybrid**: Mix of autonomous and interactive phases

## H

### Handoffs

Defined transitions between agents in multi-agent workflows, specifying when one agent passes work to another.

### Human-in-the-Loop

A coordination pattern where agents pause for human input, approval, or guidance at critical decision points.

## M

### Memory

Persistent context that spans conversations, allowing agents to remember previous interactions and maintain continuity.

### Multi-Agent Team

A coordinated group of agents working together, each with specialized roles and capabilities.

## O

### Orchestrator

The coordination layer that manages multi-agent workflows, handles handoffs, and ensures proper task execution.

## P

### Preset Agents

Built-in specialist agents provided by AgentX:

- **Researcher**: Gathers and synthesizes evidence-based research
- **Writer**: Transforms research into clear, persuasive content
- **Web Designer**: Creates interactive HTML experiences
- **Reviewer**: Provides quality assurance and final polish

### Prompt Template

Markdown files that define agent behavior, personality, and capabilities.

## S

### start_task

Task-based interface for complex multi-step workflows, returns an XAgent instance for interaction.

### Streaming

Real-time response delivery where content is sent as it's generated rather than waiting for completion.

## T

### Task

A complete workflow instance with its own workspace, memory, and execution context.

### Team

A configured group of agents with defined roles, tools, and coordination patterns.

### Tools

Functions agents can use to interact with the world:

- **Built-in Tools**: web_search, memory, file operations
- **Custom Tools**: User-defined functions for specific needs
- **External Tools**: Third-party integrations and APIs

## V

### Vibe-X Philosophy

AgentX's core principles:

- **Transparent Processes**: Real-time visibility into AI decision-making
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Strategic human oversight with AI execution
- **Cost-Aware Intelligence**: Intelligent model routing balancing capability with cost

## W

### Workspace

Isolated directory for each task containing files, artifacts, logs, and execution context.

## X

### XAgent

The conversational interface for interacting with your agent team. Perfect for chat applications and iterative refinement.

## Quick Reference

### Interface Comparison

- **XAgent**: Direct conversational interface, perfect for chat applications
- **start_task**: Task-based interface, ideal for complex multi-step workflows

### Common Patterns

- **Single Agent**: One agent handles the entire conversation
- **Sequential Workflow**: Agents work in a defined order (research → write → review)
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Iterative Refinement**: Using XAgent.chat() to refine and improve outputs
