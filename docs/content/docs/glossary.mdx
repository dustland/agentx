## A

### Agent

A specialized worker designed to perform specific types of tasks within a multi-agent system. Unlike XAgent which orchestrates the overall workflow, Agents are domain experts that receive well-defined tasks and execute them using their specialized tools and knowledge.

### Agent Types

- **Preset Agents**: Built-in specialists like researcher, writer, web_designer, reviewer
- **Custom Agents**: Define your own with custom prompts and tools
- **Tool-Heavy Agents**: Agents with extensive external integrations

### Autonomous Mode

Execution mode where agents work independently without human intervention until completion or explicit stopping condition.

## B

### Bootstrap

VibeX's project wizard (`vibex init`) that creates complete, working projects with intelligent defaults.

### Brain

The LLM-powered reasoning engine that drives agent decision-making and responses.

## C

### Configuration

YAML files that define agent teams, their roles, tools, and coordination patterns.

### Coordination Patterns

Different ways agents can work together:

- **Single Agent**: Direct conversation
- **Sequential Handoffs**: Agents pass work to next specialist
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Agents pause for human input/approval

## E

### Execution Mode

How agents operate:

- **Autonomous**: Agents work independently
- **Interactive**: Human guidance at each step
- **Hybrid**: Mix of autonomous and interactive phases

## H

### Handoffs

Defined transitions between agents in multi-agent workflows, specifying when one agent passes work to another.

### Human-in-the-Loop

A coordination pattern where agents pause for human input, approval, or guidance at critical decision points.

## M

### Memory

Persistent context that spans conversations, allowing agents to remember previous interactions and maintain continuity.

### Multi-Agent Team

A coordinated group of agents working together, each with specialized roles and capabilities.

## O

### Observability

Real-time monitoring and visibility into the VibeX system, including agent performance, task execution status, system health metrics, and workflow insights. Provides dashboards and monitoring tools for understanding system behavior.

### Orchestrator

The coordination layer that manages multi-agent workflows, handles handoffs, and ensures proper task execution.

## P

### Project

The primary unit of work in VibeX that encapsulates everything needed to achieve a high-level goal. Each project is a self-contained environment with its own isolated workspace, state, team configuration, and version control. Projects serve as the backend foundation that XAgents represent and manage.

### Preset Agents

Built-in specialist agents provided by VibeX:

- **Researcher**: Gathers and synthesizes evidence-based research
- **Writer**: Transforms research into clear, persuasive content
- **Web Designer**: Creates interactive HTML experiences
- **Developer**: Handles software implementation, code development, and system architecture
- **Reviewer**: Provides quality assurance and final polish

### Prompt Template

Markdown files that define agent behavior, personality, and capabilities.

## S

### start_task

Task-based interface for complex multi-step workflows, returns an XAgent instance for interaction.

### Status

The current execution state of an XAgent or task. Common statuses include:

- **Running**: Currently executing or processing
- **Completed**: Successfully finished execution
- **Error**: Encountered an issue during execution
- **Pending**: Waiting to start or for dependencies

### Streaming

Real-time response delivery where content is sent as it's generated rather than waiting for completion.

## T

### Task

A complete workflow instance with its own taskspace, memory, and execution context.

### Team

A configured group of agents with defined roles, tools, and coordination patterns.

### Tools

Functions agents can use to interact with the world:

- **Built-in Tools**: web_search, memory, file operations
- **Custom Tools**: User-defined functions for specific needs
- **External Tools**: Third-party integrations and APIs

### Taskspace

Isolated directory for each task containing files, artifacts, logs, and execution context.

## V

### Vibe-X Philosophy

VibeX's core principles:

- **Transparent Processes**: Real-time visibility into AI decision-making
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Strategic human oversight with AI execution
- **Cost-Aware Intelligence**: Intelligent model routing balancing capability with cost

## X

### XAgent

The Strategic Task Orchestrator and Planning System that serves as the lead coordinator for multi-agent workflows. XAgent acts as the project's conversational representative, handling task decomposition, plan creation, agent coordination, and user interaction. It's the unified interface that breaks down complex goals into manageable tasks for specialist agents.

## Quick Reference

### Interface Comparison

- **XAgent**: Direct conversational interface, perfect for chat applications
- **start_task**: Task-based interface, ideal for complex multi-step workflows

### Common Patterns

- **Single Agent**: One agent handles the entire conversation
- **Sequential Workflow**: Agents work in a defined order (research → write → review)
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Iterative Refinement**: Using XAgent.chat() to refine and improve outputs
