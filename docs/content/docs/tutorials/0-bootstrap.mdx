# Tutorial 0: Bootstrap Your First Project

**Get started with AgentX in under 2 minutes using our intelligent project wizard.**

The AgentX bootstrap wizard embodies the Vibe-X philosophy by providing optimized templates for the three core workflows of knowledge work. Instead of starting with a blank slate, you get a working system tailored to your specific use case.

## What Gets Generated

Every bootstrap project includes:

### 📁 Complete Project Structure

```
my-research-assistant/
├── config/
│   ├── team.yaml          # Agent configuration
│   └── prompts/           # Agent behavior definitions
├── workspace/             # Project workspace (auto-generated)
├── main.py               # Ready-to-run application
├── .env.example          # Environment template
└── README.md            # Comprehensive documentation
```

### 🤖 Pre-configured Agents

Each template includes 3 specialized agents with:

- **Optimized prompts** for their specific roles
- **Appropriate tool access** for their responsibilities
- **Clear handoff protocols** between agents
- **Quality standards** and best practices

### 🔧 Smart Defaults

- **Cost-effective model selection** (DeepSeek by default)
- **Collaborative execution mode** with intelligent routing
- **Memory enabled** for context retention
- **Essential tools** pre-configured (search, storage, memory)

### 📚 Production-Ready Code

- **Streaming interface** for real-time interaction
- **Error handling** and graceful degradation
- **Task tracking** with unique IDs
- **Workspace management** for organized output

## Running Your Project

After bootstrap completes:

```bash
cd my-research-assistant
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
python main.py
```

You'll get an interactive session:

```
🚀 Starting my-research-assistant
==================================================

📋 Task ID: task_abc123
📁 Workspace: /path/to/workspace/task_abc123

🤖 AI agents are ready! What would you like to work on?

👤 You: Research and write a comprehensive guide on renewable energy trends

🤖 AI: I'll help you create a comprehensive guide on renewable energy trends.
Let me start by researching the latest developments and data...

[Researcher Agent activates, searches for information, saves findings]
[Writer Agent takes over, creates structured content]
[Editor Agent reviews and polishes the final document]

## Model Selection Guide

Choose the right model for your needs:

| Provider     | Model            | Strengths                             | Best For                          |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **DeepSeek** | deepseek-chat    | Fast, cost-effective, good quality    | Most workflows, high-volume usage |
| **OpenAI**   | gpt-4o-mini      | Reliable, well-tested, good reasoning | Production systems, complex tasks |
| **Claude**   | claude-3-haiku   | Excellent reasoning, ethical, helpful | Research, analysis, writing       |
| **Gemini**   | gemini-1.5-flash | Multimodal, fast, Google integration  | Creative tasks, data analysis     |

You can always change models later by editing `config/team.yaml`.

## Customization Options

### Command Line Flags

```bash
# Non-interactive mode with specific template
agentx init my-project --template coding --model openai --no-interactive

# Interactive mode (default)
agentx init

# Specify project name upfront
agentx init my-awesome-project
```

### Template Customization

After generation, you can customize:

1. **Agent Prompts**: Edit files in `config/prompts/`
2. **Tool Configuration**: Modify `tools` section in `config/team.yaml`
3. **Model Settings**: Adjust `llm_config` for each agent
4. **Execution Parameters**: Change `max_rounds`, `timeout_seconds`, etc.

---

## Cost Optimization

Bootstrap projects are configured for cost-effective operation:

- **DeepSeek by default**: Up to 90% cost savings vs GPT-4
- **Efficient prompting**: Agents designed for minimal token usage
- **Smart tool selection**: Only necessary tools are loaded
- **Collaborative mode**: Agents work together to minimize redundant work

**Estimated costs** (per 1000 user interactions):

- DeepSeek: ~$2-5
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini: ~$10-20
- Claude Haiku: ~$8-15
- Gemini Flash: ~$3-8

---

## Next Steps

Once you have a working project:

1. **Experiment**: Try different prompts and see how agents respond
2. **Customize**: Modify agent behavior by editing prompt files
3. **Scale**: Add more agents or upgrade to more powerful models
4. **Deploy**: Use `agentx start` to run as a service
5. **Learn**: Explore [Tutorial 1: Your First Agent](/docs/tutorials/1-first-agent) for deeper concepts

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Directory already exists" error?**

- Choose a different project name or remove the existing directory

**Agents not responding?**

- Check your API keys in `.env`
- Verify internet connection
- Try `agentx status` to check configuration

**Want to start over?**

- Delete the project directory and run `agentx init` again
- Or modify the existing configuration files

## Philosophy: Fast Start, Full Control

The bootstrap wizard embodies AgentX's core philosophy:

- **Fast Start**: Get productive immediately with working templates
- **Full Control**: Every file is editable, nothing is hidden or locked
- **Best Practices**: Templates encode proven patterns and optimizations
- **Escape Hatches**: You can always customize or completely rewrite

This is the "Vibe-X" approach: intelligent defaults that get you started, with complete transparency and control as you grow.

**Ready to build something amazing?** Run `agentx init` and let's get started! 🚀
