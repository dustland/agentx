# Tutorial 5: Research Workflows

Learn how to build effective research agents that conduct comprehensive web research, extract detailed information, and save structured findings to workspace files.

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to create research workflows using AgentX's builtin tools for web search, content extraction, and file storage. You'll learn how to:

- Start tasks with clear workspace organization
- Use web search and content extraction tools effectively
- Save comprehensive research findings to files
- Track task progress with task IDs

## The Research Challenge

Traditional research workflows often produce:

- Brief, generic summaries that lack depth
- Missing source citations and context
- No systematic organization of findings
- Difficulty reproducing or building on results

AgentX's research workflow solves these problems with:

- **Detailed extraction prompts** that specify exactly what information to gather
- **Systematic file organization** with clear workspace structure
- **Comprehensive documentation** with full context and citations
- **Reproducible methodology** through consistent agent prompts

## Building a Research Agent

Let's create a research agent that demonstrates proper methodology:

### 1. Agent Configuration

```yaml
# config/simple_research.yaml
name: "Simple Research Demo"
description: "Demonstrates effective use of web research methodology"

agents:
  - name: researcher
    description: "Research specialist who demonstrates proper web research methodology"
    prompt_template: "prompts/researcher.md"
    llm_config:
      model: deepseek/deepseek-chat
      temperature: 0.1
      max_tokens: 2000
    # No tools specified - builtin tools are automatically registered

# Single agent - no handoffs needed
handoffs: []

# Orchestrator configuration
orchestrator:
  max_rounds: 10
  timeout: 1800
  brain_config:
    model: deepseek/deepseek-chat
    temperature: 0.0
    max_tokens: 100

# Execution configuration
execution:
  mode: "autonomous"
  max_rounds: 10
  timeout_seconds: 1800
  initial_agent: "researcher"
```

### 2. Research Methodology Prompt

The key to effective research is a detailed prompt that teaches proper methodology:

```markdown
# Research Specialist - Demonstration Agent

You are a research specialist demonstrating the **correct methodology** for conducting comprehensive web research.

## Your Mission

Show how to transform a research topic into detailed, valuable findings by:

1. **Finding the best sources** through strategic online research
2. **Extracting comprehensive content** with detailed, specific requests
3. **Documenting findings systematically** with full context and analysis

## Step-by-Step Research Methodology

### Step 1: Plan Your Research Strategy

Break down the research topic into specific, searchable questions:

- What are the key aspects to investigate?
- What types of sources will be most valuable?
- What specific information do you need to extract?

### Step 2: Find the Best Sources

Search for information using focused, specific queries:

- **Good**: "quantum computing drug discovery 2024 breakthroughs"
- **Good**: "IBM quantum pharmaceutical partnerships case studies"
- **Bad**: "quantum computing" (too broad)

### Step 3: Extract Comprehensive Content

This is the **CRITICAL** step that determines research quality.

When requesting information from sources, be extremely specific about what you need:

**‚ùå WRONG WAY (produces brief, useless summaries)**:

- "Get information about quantum computing in drug discovery"
- "Summarize the content"

**‚úÖ CORRECT WAY (produces comprehensive, valuable content)**:

- Request: "Extract comprehensive information about quantum computing applications in drug discovery including: 1) Specific quantum algorithms being used (QAOA, VQE, etc.) with technical details, 2) Real company partnerships and collaborations with names, dates, and outcomes, 3) Actual drug discovery projects and their results with molecule names and development stages, 4) Performance comparisons between quantum and classical approaches with specific metrics..."

### Step 4: Document Comprehensive Findings

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS**:

1. **Save ALL research findings to files** - Every piece of research must be documented
2. **Create comprehensive reports** - Each finding should be 500+ words with full details
3. **Use specific filenames** - e.g., "quantum_partnerships.md", "technical_analysis.md"

**EXECUTION STEPS**:

1. **Plan**: Create research strategy and save as "research_plan.md"
2. **Research**: Conduct searches and extract detailed content
3. **Document**: Save each finding as a separate .md file with comprehensive analysis
4. **Summarize**: Create final "research_summary.md" with key insights

**CRITICAL**: You MUST save research findings to files. Use `write_file` tool for every piece of research you gather.
```

### 3. Main Application

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Simple Research Example

Demonstrates how to use web_search and extract_content tools effectively
with detailed prompts to get comprehensive, valuable research content.
"""

import asyncio
from agentx import start_task

async def main():
    """Run a simple research demonstration."""

    print("üî¨ Simple Research Example")
    print("=" * 60)
    print("Task: 'Research quantum computing for drug discovery'")
    print("Demonstrating: How agent prompt guides proper research methodology")
    print("Key Learning: Simple task + detailed agent prompt = comprehensive research")
    print("-" * 60)

    # Super simple task prompt - the agent prompt will guide the methodology
    research_prompt = "Research quantum computing for drug discovery"

    print(f"üéØ Research Task: {research_prompt[:100]}...")
    print("-" * 60)

    # Start the research task and get task executor with task ID
    task_executor = start_task(
        prompt=research_prompt,
        config_path="config/simple_research.yaml"
    )

    print(f"üìã Task ID: {task_executor.task.task_id}")
    print(f"üìÅ Workspace: workspace/{task_executor.task.task_id}/artifacts/")
    print("-" * 60)

    # Execute the task step by step until completion
    while not task_executor.is_complete:
        async for result in task_executor.step():
            # The step method already handles all the printing and flow control
            pass

    print(f"\n‚úÖ Research completed!")
    print(f"üìÑ Check workspace/{task_executor.task.task_id}/artifacts/ for research findings")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Task ID and Workspace Management

```python
# Start task and get workspace information
task_executor = start_task(prompt, config_path)
print(f"üìã Task ID: {task_executor.task.task_id}")
print(f"üìÅ Workspace: workspace/{task_executor.task.task_id}/artifacts/")
```

The task ID provides:

- **Unique workspace identification** - Each task gets its own folder
- **Easy file location** - Users know exactly where to find results
- **Task resumption capability** - Can reference specific task runs
- **Organized output** - No file conflicts between different research sessions

### 2. Step-by-Step Execution

```python
# Execute until completion with full visibility
while not task_executor.is_complete:
    async for result in task_executor.step():
        pass  # Framework handles all logging and orchestration
```

Benefits:

- **Transparent progress** - See each agent decision and tool call
- **Orchestrator visibility** - Understand routing decisions
- **Tool call tracking** - Monitor web searches, extractions, and file saves
- **Error handling** - Clear feedback when tools fail

### 3. Builtin Tools Integration

The research agent automatically has access to:

- **`web_search`** - Find relevant sources with targeted queries
- **`extract_content`** - Pull detailed information from web pages
- **`write_file`** - Save research findings to workspace
- **`read_file`** - Access previously saved research
- **`list_directory`** - See what files have been created

### 4. Quality Research Methodology

The prompt teaches:

- **Specific extraction requests** instead of generic summaries
- **Systematic documentation** with comprehensive details
- **Source citation** and context preservation
- **Structured output** with clear organization

## Running the Example

1. **Clone and setup**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentx
   cd agentx/examples/simple_research
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install agentx-py
   ```

3. **Set environment variables**:

   ```bash
   export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="your_firecrawl_key"  # For content extraction
   export SERPAPI_API_KEY="your_serpapi_key"      # For web search
   ```

4. **Run the research**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Expected Output

The agent will:

1. **Show task information**:

   ```
   üìã Task ID: i3e82AAe
   üìÅ Workspace: workspace/i3e82AAe/artifacts/
   ```

2. **Conduct systematic research**:

   ```
   üîß TOOL CALL START | Tool: web_search
   üîß TOOL CALL START | Tool: extract_content
   üîß TOOL CALL START | Tool: write_file
   ```

3. **Create comprehensive files**:
   ```
   workspace/i3e82AAe/artifacts/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ quantum_computing_drug_discovery_summary.md
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ research_plan.md
   ```

## Best Practices

### 1. Detailed Extraction Prompts

Instead of:

```python
"Summarize this article about quantum computing"
```

Use:

```python
"Extract comprehensive information including: 1) Specific algorithms with technical details, 2) Company partnerships with names and dates, 3) Performance metrics comparing approaches, 4) Investment amounts and funding details, 5) Expert quotes and analysis..."
```

### 2. Systematic File Organization

- **One topic per file** - Don't mix unrelated research
- **Descriptive filenames** - `quantum_partnerships.md` not `research1.md`
- **Comprehensive content** - 500+ words with full context
- **Source citations** - Always include URLs and publication details

### 3. Iterative Research Process

1. **Start broad** - Get overview of the topic
2. **Drill down** - Focus on specific aspects
3. **Cross-reference** - Verify information across sources
4. **Synthesize** - Create comprehensive summary

## Next Steps

- **Try different research topics** - Test the methodology on various subjects
- **Customize the prompt** - Adapt for your specific research needs
- **Add specialized tools** - Integrate domain-specific APIs
- **Scale to teams** - Add multiple agents for different research aspects

The research workflow pattern demonstrated here can be adapted for any domain requiring systematic information gathering and documentation.
