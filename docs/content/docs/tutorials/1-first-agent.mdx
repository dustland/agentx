# Tutorial 1: Your First Agent

**‚è±Ô∏è Time: 15 minutes | üéØ Goal: Build a simple chat agent**

In this tutorial, you'll create your first AgentX agent - a helpful assistant that can chat with users. This is the foundation for everything else you'll build with AgentX.

## What You'll Learn

- Basic AgentX project structure
- Agent configuration with YAML
- Prompt engineering for agents
- Running and interacting with agents
- Understanding the TaskExecutor

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- AgentX installed (`pip install agentx-py`)
- DeepSeek API key (get one free at [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com))

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Let's create a clean project structure for your first agent:

```bash
# Create a new project directory
mkdir my-first-agent
cd my-first-agent

# Create the basic structure
mkdir -p config/prompts
mkdir workspace
```

Your project structure should look like this:

```
my-first-agent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team.yaml           # Agent configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts/            # Agent prompt files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workspace/              # Working directory for agents
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                 # Main application (we'll create this)
```

## Step 2: Create Your Agent Configuration

The heart of any AgentX system is the configuration file. Create `config/team.yaml`:

```yaml
name: "my_first_agent"
description: "My first AgentX agent - a helpful assistant"

# Define your agents
agents:
  - name: "assistant"
    description: "Helpful AI assistant"
    prompt_template: "prompts/assistant.md"
    tools: []
    llm_config:
      provider: "deepseek"
      model: "deepseek-chat"
      base_url: "https://api.deepseek.com"
      temperature: 0.7
      max_tokens: 4000
      supports_function_calls: true

# No custom tools for this simple example
tools: []

# Execution configuration
execution:
  mode: "autonomous"
  initial_agent: "assistant"
  max_rounds: 10
  timeout_seconds: 300

# Memory disabled for simplicity
memory:
  enabled: false
```

### Understanding the Configuration

- **`name`**: Identifies your agent system
- **`agents`**: List of agents in your system (just one for now)
- **`prompt_template`**: Path to the agent's behavior definition
- **`llm_config`**: Which AI model to use and how to configure it
- **`execution`**: How the agent system should run
- **`memory`**: Whether to remember past conversations (disabled for now)

## Step 3: Write Your Agent's Prompt

The prompt defines your agent's personality and behavior. Create `config/prompts/assistant.md`:

```markdown
# Helpful Assistant

You are a helpful AI assistant created with AgentX. Your role is to:

- Answer questions clearly and accurately
- Be friendly and professional
- Help users understand complex topics
- Admit when you don't know something

## Guidelines

- Keep responses concise but thorough
- Use examples when helpful
- Ask clarifying questions if needed
- Always be respectful and helpful

## Response Format

Respond naturally in a conversational tone. No special formatting required.
```

### Prompt Engineering Tips

- **Be specific**: Clear instructions lead to better behavior
- **Set the tone**: Define personality and communication style
- **Provide examples**: Show the agent how to behave in different situations
- **Set boundaries**: Explain what the agent should and shouldn't do

## Step 4: Create the Main Application

Now let's create the Python application that runs your agent. Create `main.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from agentx.core.task import TaskExecutor

async def main():
    print("ü§ñ My First AgentX Agent")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit\n")

    # Load the agent configuration
    config_path = Path(__file__).parent / "config" / "team.yaml"
    task_executor = TaskExecutor(str(config_path))

    # Main chat loop
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ").strip()
        if user_input.lower() in ['quit', 'q', 'exit']:
            print("Goodbye! üëã")
            break

        # Stream the agent's response
        print("Assistant: ", end="", flush=True)
        async for chunk in task_executor.execute_task(user_input, stream=True):
            if chunk.get("type") == "content":
                print(chunk.get("content", ""), end="", flush=True)
        print("\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Understanding the Code

- **`TaskExecutor`**: The main class for running AgentX agents
- **`execute_task`**: Processes user input and generates responses
- **`stream=True`**: Enables real-time response streaming
- **Async/await**: AgentX uses asynchronous programming for better performance

## Step 5: Run Your Agent

Set up your environment and run the agent:

```bash
# Set your API key (replace with your actual key)
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run your agent
python main.py
```

You should see:

```
ü§ñ My First AgentX Agent
Type 'quit' to exit

You:
```

## Step 6: Test Your Agent

Try these example conversations:

**Example 1: Simple Question**

```
You: What is AgentX?
Assistant: AgentX is a multi-agent framework that allows you to build AI applications with multiple specialized agents working together...
```

**Example 2: Ask for Help**

```
You: Can you help me understand Python decorators?
Assistant: I'd be happy to help! Python decorators are a way to modify or extend the behavior of functions...
```

**Example 3: Test Boundaries**

```
You: What's the weather like?
Assistant: I don't have access to real-time weather data, but I can help you understand how to add weather capabilities to agents in later tutorials...
```

## üéâ Congratulations!

You've successfully built your first AgentX agent! Here's what you accomplished:

‚úÖ **Created a project structure** with proper organization
‚úÖ **Configured an agent** using YAML
‚úÖ **Wrote a prompt** that defines agent behavior
‚úÖ **Built a Python application** that runs the agent
‚úÖ **Tested real conversations** with streaming responses

## üí° Key Concepts Learned

- **Team Configuration**: YAML files define your agent setup
- **Prompt Templates**: Markdown files define agent behavior and personality
- **TaskExecutor**: The main class for running agents and processing tasks
- **Streaming**: Real-time response generation for better user experience
- **Project Structure**: Organized file layout for maintainable agent systems

## üöÄ What's Next?

Your agent works great, but it's working alone. In [Tutorial 2: Multi-Agent Collaboration](/docs/tutorials/2-multi-agent), you'll learn how to create teams of agents that work together to solve more complex problems.

### Preview: What You'll Build Next

- A **writer agent** that creates content
- A **reviewer agent** that improves the content
- **Agent handoffs** where agents pass work between each other
- **Collaborative workflows** where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Agent not responding?**

- Check your API key is set correctly
- Verify your internet connection
- Make sure the config file path is correct

**Getting errors?**

- Check that all files are in the right locations
- Verify YAML syntax (indentation matters!)
- Look at the error messages for clues

**Want to experiment?**

- Try changing the `temperature` in the config (0.1 = focused, 0.9 = creative)
- Modify the prompt to change the agent's personality
- Add more specific instructions for different types of questions
