# manager

Tool Manager - Unified tool registry and execution for task isolation.

Combines ToolRegistry and ToolExecutor into a single manager class that provides both tool registration and execution capabilities. This simplifies the Agent interface and ensures task-level tool isolation.

```python
from agentx.tool.manager import ...
```

## Classes

### ToolManager

```python
class ToolManager
```

Unified tool manager that combines registry and execution.

This class provides task-level tool isolation by maintaining its own registry and executor. Each task gets its own ToolManager instance to prevent tool conflicts between tasks.

#### Methods

##### __init__

```python
def __init__(self, task_id)
```

Initialize tool manager with task isolation.


##### register_tool

```python
def register_tool(self, tool)
```

Register a tool with this task's registry.


##### list_tools

```python
def list_tools(self)
```

Get list of all registered tool names.


##### get_tool_schemas

```python
def get_tool_schemas(self, tool_names)
```

Get JSON schemas for tools.


##### get_tool_function

```python
def get_tool_function(self, name)
```

Get a tool function by name.


##### get_tool

```python
def get_tool(self, name)
```

Get a tool instance by name for direct access.


##### get_builtin_tools

```python
def get_builtin_tools(self)
```

Get list of all builtin tool names.


##### get_custom_tools

```python
def get_custom_tools(self)
```

Get list of all custom (non-builtin) tool names.


##### execute_tool

```python
def execute_tool(self, tool_name, agent_name, **kwargs)
```

Execute a single tool.


##### execute_tools

```python
def execute_tools(self, tool_calls, agent_name)
```

Execute multiple tool calls.


##### get_execution_stats

```python
def get_execution_stats(self)
```

Get execution statistics.


##### get_tool_count

```python
def get_tool_count(self)
```

Get the number of registered tools.


##### clear_tools

```python
def clear_tools(self)
```

Clear all registered tools (useful for testing).
