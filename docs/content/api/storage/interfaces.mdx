#### Methods

##### store_artifact

```python
def store_artifact(self, name, content, content_type, metadata)
```

Store an artifact with versioning.


##### get_artifact

```python
def get_artifact(self, name, version)
```

##### list_artifacts

```python
def list_artifacts(self)
```

List all artifacts with their metadata.


##### get_artifact_versions

```python
def get_artifact_versions(self, name)
```

Get all versions of an artifact.


##### delete_artifact

```python
def delete_artifact(self, name, version)
```

Delete an artifact or specific version.
