# factory

Storage factory - Creates storage providers using factory pattern.

Separates pure filesystem abstraction from business logic.

```python
from agentx.storage.factory import ...
```

## Classes

### StorageFactory

```python
class StorageFactory
```

Factory for creating storage providers.

Creates filesystem abstractions that can be swapped for different backends (local, S3, Azure, etc.) and workspace storage for business logic.

#### Methods

##### create_file_storage

```python
def create_file_storage(base_path)
```

Create a filesystem abstraction.

This can be swapped for different backends like S3FileStorage, AzureFileStorage, etc. without changing the business logic.


##### create_workspace_storage

```python
def create_workspace_storage(workspace_path, use_git_artifacts)
```

Create a workspace storage for business logic.

Handles business concepts like artifacts, messages, execution plans using the filesystem abstraction underneath.



## Functions

### create_file_storage

```python
def create_file_storage(base_path)
```

Create a filesystem abstraction.

This can be swapped for different backends like S3FileStorage, AzureFileStorage, etc. without changing the business logic.

**Arguments:**

- `base_path`: Base path for the filesystem

**Returns:**

FileStorage implementation


### create_workspace_storage

```python
def create_workspace_storage(workspace_path, use_git_artifacts)
```

Create a workspace storage for business logic.

Handles business concepts like artifacts, messages, execution plans using the filesystem abstraction underneath.

**Arguments:**

- `workspace_path`: Path to the workspace directory
- `use_git_artifacts`: Whether to use Git for artifact versioning

**Returns:**

WorkspaceStorage instance
