# git_storage

Git-based artifact storage - Uses Git for proper versioning.

Provides Git-based versioning for artifacts, especially useful for code generation where we need proper diffs, branching, and version history.

```python
from agentx.storage.git_storage import ...
```

## Classes

### GitArtifactStorage

```python
class GitArtifactStorage
```

Git-based artifact storage with proper version control.

Uses Git for versioning artifacts, providing: - Proper diffs and history - Branching and merging capabilities - Standard Git tooling integration - Efficient storage with delta compression - Meaningful commit messages

```python
def get_artifact(self, name, version)
```

Get artifact content at specific version (commit).


##### list_artifacts

```python
def list_artifacts(self)
```

List all artifacts with their Git history.


##### get_artifact_versions

##### delete_artifact

```python
def delete_artifact(self, name, version)
```

##### get_artifact_diff

```python
def get_artifact_diff(self, name, version1, version2)
```

Get diff between two versions of an artifact.


##### list_directory

```python
def list_directory(self, path)
```

List directory contents (returns artifacts for compatibility).


##### create_directory

```python
def create_directory(self, path)
```

Create directory (no-op for git storage).


##### exists

```python
def exists(self, path)
```

Check if artifact exists.


##### read_text

```python
def read_text(self, path)
```

Read text content (alias for get_artifact).


##### write_text

```python
def write_text(self, path, content)
```

Write text content (alias for store_artifact).


##### write_bytes

```python
def write_bytes(self, path, content)
