# task

Task execution class - the primary interface for AgentX task execution.

Clean API: # One-shot execution (Lead-driven) await execute_task(prompt, config_path) # Step-by-step execution (Lead-driven) task = start_task(prompt, config_path) await task.run()

```python
from agentx.core.task import ...
```

## Classes

### Task

```python
class Task
```

Represents the state and context of a single task being executed.

This class is a data container and does not have execution logic.

#### Methods

##### __init__

```python
def __init__(self, task_id, config, history, message_queue, agents, workspace, orchestrator, initial_prompt)
```


##### get_agent

```python
def get_agent(self, name)
```

Retrieves an agent by name.


##### complete

```python
def complete(self)
```

Marks the task as complete.


##### get_context

```python
def get_context(self)
```

Returns a dictionary with the task's context.



### TaskExecutor

```python
class TaskExecutor
```

The main engine for executing a task. It coordinates the agents, tools,

and orchestrator to fulfill the user's request.

#### Methods

##### __init__

```python
def __init__(self, team_config, task_id, workspace_dir)
```


##### start

```python
def start(self, prompt, stream)
```

Starts the task execution and streams back events.



## Functions

### execute_task

```python
def execute_task(prompt, config_path, stream)
```

High-level function to execute a task from a prompt and config file.

This function runs the task to completion autonomously.


### start_task

```python
def start_task(prompt, config_path, task_id, workspace_dir)
```

High-level function to start a task and return the TaskExecutor for step-by-step execution.

This function is ideal for interactive scenarios where you want to: - Execute tasks step by step - Inspect task state between steps - Modify task configuration during execution - Build interactive UIs with manual control

**Arguments:**

- `prompt`: The initial task prompt
- `config_path`: Path to the team configuration file
- `task_id`: Optional custom task ID
- `workspace_dir`: Optional custom workspace directory

**Returns:**

TaskExecutor: The initialized executor ready for step-by-step execution


### get_agent

### get_context

```python
def get_context(self)
```
