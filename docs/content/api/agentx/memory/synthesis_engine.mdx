# synthesis_engine

Memory Synthesis Engine

The intelligent core of the Memory System that analyzes events and creates structured memories (Constraints, Hot Issues, Document Chunks) as specified in the architecture document.

```python
from agentx.memory.synthesis_engine import ...
```

## Classes

### MemorySynthesisEngine

```python
class MemorySynthesisEngine
```

The logical core of the Memory System that analyzes events and creates memories.

Implements the event-driven analysis logic specified in the architecture: - Analyzes user messages for constraints/preferences - Detects tool failures and creates hot issues - Resolves hot issues when tools succeed - Chunks document content for semantic search

#### Methods

##### __init__

```python
def __init__(self, memory_backend, brain)
```


##### on_event

```python
def on_event(self, event)
```

Main event handler - routes events to appropriate analysis methods.

This implements the event handling logic from the architecture document.


##### get_relevant_context

```python
def get_relevant_context(self, last_user_message, agent_name)
```

Get relevant context for injection into agent prompts.

This implements the context retrieval logic from the architecture document.
