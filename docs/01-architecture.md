# AgentX System Architecture

## Executive Summary

AgentX is an enterprise-grade multi-agent orchestration framework designed for autonomous task execution through intelligent agent collaboration. The system employs a **microkernel architecture** with **centralized orchestration** to provide secure, scalable, and observable multi-agent workflows while maintaining strict isolation boundaries and event-driven coordination.

## 1. Architectural Vision & Principles

### 1.1 Core Vision
AgentX transforms complex tasks into coordinated multi-agent workflows where specialized agents collaborate autonomously under centralized governance to achieve objectives that exceed individual agent capabilities.

### 1.2 Architectural Principles

**Separation of Concerns**: Each subsystem has a single, well-defined responsibility with minimal overlap.

**Centralized Orchestration**: All coordination, security, and resource management flows through a central orchestrator to ensure consistency and control.

**Agent Autonomy**: Agents operate independently within their domains while delegating cross-cutting concerns to specialized subsystems.

**Event-Driven Coordination**: Asynchronous, loosely-coupled communication through structured events enables scalability and observability.

**Configuration-Driven Behavior**: System behavior is defined declaratively through configuration, enabling rapid iteration without code changes.

**Security by Design**: All external interactions and resource access are mediated through secured, audited channels.

**Workspace Isolation**: Each task execution operates in an isolated workspace with versioned state and artifacts.

## 2. System Quality Attributes

### 2.1 Primary Quality Attributes

**Scalability**: Support concurrent multi-agent workflows with linear resource scaling
**Security**: Zero-trust architecture with centralized access control and audit trails  
**Observability**: Complete visibility into system behavior through events and metrics
**Extensibility**: Pluggable architecture for agents, tools, and backends
**Reliability**: Fault tolerance through isolation boundaries and graceful degradation

### 2.2 Trade-off Decisions

| Attribute | Design Choice | Trade-off |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Security vs Performance | Centralized tool execution | Higher latency for enhanced security |
| Flexibility vs Complexity | Configuration-driven behavior | Learning curve for declarative approach |
| Autonomy vs Control | Mediated agent interactions | Agent capabilities constrained by orchestrator |
| Observability vs Performance | Comprehensive event emission | Event processing overhead |
